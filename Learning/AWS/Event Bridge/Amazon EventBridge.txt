Amazon EventBridge (formerly CloudWatch Events)
	Schedule: Cron jobs ( schedules scripts)
	Event Pattern: Event rules to react to a service doing something 
		Example: You want to get notification such as email when someone is logging in with Root account
	Trigger Lambda functions, send SQS/SNS message
	
	You can send event to AWS Partner such as Zendesk, datadog and outside AWS
	
	You can send event to EventBridge from your own application
	
	Event buses can be accessed by other AWS Account using Resource-based Policy
	You can archive event (all/filter) sent to an event bus (indefinitely or set period)
	Ability to replay archived event

Schema Registry
	EnvetBridge can analyze the events in your bus and infer the schema
	The Schema Registry allows you to generate code for your application, that will know in advance how data is structure in the evnet bus
	Shema can be versioned

Resource-based Policy
	Manage permissions for a specific Event Bus
	Example: allow/deny events from another AWS account or AWS regions
	Use cases: aggregate all events from your AWs Organization in a single AWS account or AWS regions
