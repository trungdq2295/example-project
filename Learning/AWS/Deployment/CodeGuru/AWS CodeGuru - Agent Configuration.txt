AWS CodeGuru - Agent Configuration
  MaxStackDepth - the maximum depth of the stacks in the code that is represented in the profile
    Example: If CodeGuru Profiler finds a method A, which calls method B, which call method C, which call method D, then the depth is 4
    If the MaxStackDepth is set to 2, then the profiler evaluates method A and B
  MemoryUsageLimitPercent - the memory percentage used by the profiler
  MinimumTimeForReportingInMilliseconds - the minium time between sending reports (milliseconds)
    This mean when report's ready, you have to wait "N" milliseconds before sending
  ReportingIntervalInMilliseconds - the reporting interval used to report profilers (milliseconds)
    The CodeGuru profiler will send report every "N" milliseconds
  SamplingIntervalMilliseconds - the sampling interval that is used to profile samples (milliseconds)
    Reduce to have a higher sampling rate
    Example: This is how often the CodeGuru Profiler collect a sample

  So the scenario is like this
    SamplingIntervalMilliseconds -> ReportingIntervalInMilliseconds -> MinimumTimeForReportingInMilliseconds
    Collect sample, sample, sample -> waiting for report interval done so i -> waiting for reporting time before sending
