AWS CodeCommit
    is like github,Bitbucket
    Version control is the ability to understand the various changes that happened to the code over time( and possibly rollback)
    All these are enabled by using a version control system such as Git
    a Git repository can be synchronized on your computer but it usually is uploaded to a central online repository
    Benefits are
        Collaborate with other developers
        Make sure the code is backed-up somewhere
        Make sure it's fully viewable and auditable
    AWS CodeCommit
        Private git repositories
        No size limit on repositories (scale seamlessly)
        Fully managed, highly available
        Code only in AWS Cloud Account => increased security and compliance
        Security (encrypted, access control, ...)
    Integrated with Jenkins, AWS CodeBuild, and other CI tools
    Security
        Interaction are done using Git (standard)
        Authentication
            SSH Keys - AWS Users can configure SSH keys in their IAM console
            HTTPS - with AWS CLI Credential helper or Git credentials for IAM user
        Authorization
            IAM policies to manage users/roles permission to repositories
        Encryption
            Repositories are automatically encrypted at rest using AWS KMS
            Encrypted in transit ( can only use HTTPS or SSH - both secure)
        Cross-account Access
            Do not share your SSh keys or your AWS Credentials
            Use an IAM Role in your AWS account and use AWS STS (AssumeRole API)
