AWS CodePipeline
    Just think it's like Jenkin
    Visual Workflow to orchestrate your CICD
    Source - CodeCommit, ECR, S3, Bitbucket, Github
    Build - CodeBuild, Jenkins, CloudBees, TeamCity
    Test - CodeBuild, AWS Device Farm, 3rd party tools,..
    Deploy - CodeDeploy, Elastic Beanstalk, CloudFormation, ECS, S3, ..
    Invoke - Lambda, Step Functions
    Consists of stage
        Each stage can have sequential actions and/or parallel actions
        Example: Build -> Test -> Deploy -> Load Testing
        Manual approval can be defined at any stage
    Each pipeline stage can create artifacts and stored in an S3 bucket and passed on to the next stage
    So the idea is
        When developer commit the code to Github, gitlab,...
        These will output an artifact and stored in S3 bucket
        AWS CodeBuild will pull the artifact from S3 and build and output a news one to store in S3 again
        AWS CodeDeploy will pull that new one and deploy
    Troubleshooting
        For CodePipeline Pipeline/Action/Stage Execution State Changes
        Use CloudWatch Events (Amazon EventBridge). Example:
            You can create events for failed pipeline
            You can create events for cancelled pipeline
        If CodePipeline fails a stage, your pipeline stops, and you can get information in the console
        If pipeline can't perform an action, make sure the "IAM service role" attached does have enough IAM permissions (IAM policy)
        AWS CloudTrail can be used to audit AWS API calls
