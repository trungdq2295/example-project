AWS CodeBuild
    to take source of code (Github, S3, Bitbucket)
    And build the code
    To Build instructions: You have to involve a file buildspec.yml in your codebase or insert it manually in Console
    Output logs can be stored in S3 and CloudWatch Logs
    Use CloudWatch Metric to monitor build statistic
    Use EventBridge to detect failed builds and trigger notifications
    Use CloudWatch Alarms to notify if you need "threshold" for failures
    Build Projects can be defined within CodePipeline or CodeBuild
    Supported Environment
        JAva, Ruby, Python, Go, NodeJS, Android, .NET Core, PHP, Docker image
    How it works
        First CodeBuild will run all instructions from buildspec.yml file
        And Codebuild has an option to cache a reusable pieces which can be reuse from build to build
            This is an optimization for faster build
        Then all the logs can be stored in S3 or CloudWatch Logs if you enable it
        So when CodeBuild is done, it can produce some artifacts and these artifacts will be extracted out and put into S3

    buildspec.yml
        This file must be at the root of your code
        env - define environment variables
            variables - plaintext variables
            parameter-store - variables stored in SSM Parameter Store
            secrets-manager - variables stored in AWS Secrets Manager
        phases - specify commands to run:
            install - install dependencies you may need for your build
            pre_build - final commands to execute before build
            Build - actual build commands
            post_build - finishing touches (e.g, zip output)
        artifacts - what to uplaod to S3 (encrypted with KMS)
