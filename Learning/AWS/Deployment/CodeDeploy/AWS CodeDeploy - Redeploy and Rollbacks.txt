AWS CodeDeploy - Redeploy and Rollbacks
  Rollback = redeploy a previous deployed revision of your application
  Deployments can be rolled back:
    Automatically - rollback when a deployment fails or rollback when a CloudWatch Alarm thresholds are met
    Manually
  Disable Rollbacks - do not perform rollbacks for this deployment
  If a roll back happens, CodeDeploy redeploys the last known good revision as a new deployment (not a restored version)
