AWS CodeDeploy
  Deployment service that automates application deployment
  Deploy new applications versions to EC2 Instances, On-premises servers, Lambda functions, ECS services
  Automated Rollback capability in case of failed deployments, or trigger CloudWatch Alarms
  Gradual deployment control
  A file named appspec.yml defines how the deployment happens
  Important Note: You need to create role for CodeDeploy so it can deploy to other services

  EC2/On-premises platform
    Can deploy to EC2 Instance & on-premises server
    Perform in-place deployments or blue/green deployments
    Must run the CodeDeploy Agent on the target instances
    Define deployment speed
      AllAtOnce: most downtime // rollout all new version at a time
      HalfAtATime: Reduce capacity by 50%
      OneAtATime: slowest, lowest availability impact
      Custom: define your % capacity
    Deploy to an ASG
      In-place Deployment
        Updates existing EC2 instances
        Newly created EC2 instances by an ASG will also get automated deployments
      Blue/Green Deployment
        A new Auto-Scaling Group is created (settings are copied)
        Choose how long to keep the old EC2 instances (old ASG)
        Must be using an ALB

  CodeDeployAgent
    The CodeDeploy Agent must be running on the EC2 instances as a pre-requisites
    It can be installed and updated automatically if you're using System Manager
    The EC2 Instances must have sufficient permissions to access Amazon S3 to get deployment bundles
      So it can download it from S3

  Lambda Platform
    CodeDeploy can help you automate traffic shift for Lambda aliases
    Feature is integrated within the SAM Framework
    Linear: grow traffic every N minutes until 100%
      LambdaLinear10PercentEvery3Minutes
      LambdaLinear10PercentEvery10Minutes
      The idea is you have PROD alias running at version 1, and then you deploy version 2
        CodeDeploy will help you to route "X" traffic to version and the rest to PROD alias
        Traffic will grow every N minutes until it reach 100%
    Canary: try X percent then 100%
      LambdaCanary10Percent5Minutes
      LambdaCanary10Percent30Minutes
    AllAtOne: immediate
  ECS Platform
    CodeDeploy can help you automate the deployment of a new ECS Task Definition
    Only Blue/Green Deployments
    Linear: grow traffic every N minutes until 100%
      ECSLinear10PercentEvery3Minutes
      ECSLinear10PercentEvery10Minutes
    Canary: try X percent then 100%
      ECSCanary10Percent5Minutes
      ECSCanary10Percent30Minutes
    AllAtOne: immediate

  Redeploy & Rollbacks
