AWS CodeArtifact
  Software packages depend on each other to be build (also called dependencies), and new ones are created
  Storing and retrieving these dependencies is called artifact management
  Traditionally you need to setup your own artifact management system
  CodeArtifact is a secure, scalable, and cost-effective artifact management for software development
  Works with common dependency management tools such as Maven, Gradle, npm, yarn, twine, pip, and NuGet
  Developers and CodeBuild can then retrieve dependencies straight from CodeArtifact

  Event Bridge Integration
    Event is created when a Package is created, modified, or deleted
    CodePipeline will listen to the event and can be triggered to rebuild your application
    This might be help you to improve dependencies such as security
  Resource Policy
    Can be used to authorize another account to access CodeArtifact
    A given principal can either read all the packages in a repository or none of them
