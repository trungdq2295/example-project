Cross-Zone Load Balancing
    With Cross zone load balancing
        each load balancer instance distributes evenly across all registered instances in all AZ
        Example:
            2 instance at AZ eu-east-01 and 8 instances at eu-east-02
            Then client make request, it will be load seperates requests to 2 AZ, However the load balancer will combine all instances from all AZs, mean for each 100 requests, each instance will handle 10 requests
    Without Cross-Zone load balancing
        Requests are distributed in the instances of the node of the Elastic Load Balancer
        Example:
            2 instance at AZ eu-east-01 and 8 instances at eu-east-02
            When client make request, it will be load seperates requests to 2 AZ, and each az will load balance the request inside the AZ only, it mean for 100 each requests, eu-east-01 will handle 50 and it has 2 instance >>> each instance handle 25 request. eu-east-02 will handle 50 and it has 8 instance >>> each instance handle 6.25 request
