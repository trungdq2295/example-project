Connection Draining
    Feature naming
        Connection Draining - for CLB
        Deregistration Delay - for ALB & NLB
    Time to complete "in-flight requests" while the instance is de-registering or unhealthy
    Stop sending new request to the EC2 instance which is de-registering
    The idea is ELB gonna create new connection to other EC2 instance when the current one is unhealthy/draining
    Between 1 to 3600 seconds
    Can be disabled
    Set to a low value if your request a short (like latency less than 1 second)
