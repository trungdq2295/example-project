ELB - Elastic Load Balancer



Why use a load balancer?
	Spread load across multiple downstream process
	Expose a single point of access (DNS) to your application
	Seamlessly handle failure of downstream instances
	Do regular health checks to your instances
	Provide SSL termination (HTTPS) to your websites
	Enforce stickiness with cookies
	High availability across zones
	Sepearate public traffic from private traffic

 

Why use ELB?
    An Elastic Load Balancer is a managed load balancer
        AWS guarantees that it will be working
        AWS takes care of upgrades, maintenance, high availability
        AWS provides only a few configuration knobs

    It costs less to set up your own load balancer but it will be a lot more effort on your end

    It is intergrated with many AWS offering/services
        EC2, EC2 Auto Scailing Groups, Amazon ECS
        AWS Certificate Manager (ACM), CloudWatch
        Route 53, AWS WAF, AWS Global Accelerator

Health checks
    Are crucial for Load Balancer
    They enable they load balancer to know if instancess it forwards traffic to are available to reply to request
    The health check is done on a port and route(/heath is common)
    If the response  is not 200 (OK), then the instance is unhealthy

Type of ELB
    has 4 kinds of managed Load Balancers
        Classic Load Balancer (v1 - old generation) - 2009 - CLB
            HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, SSL (secure TCP)
        Application Load Balancer (v2 - new generation) - 2016 - ALB
            HTTP, HTTPS, Websocket
        Network Load Balancer (v2- new generation) - 2017 - NLB
            TCP, TLS (secure TCP), UDP
        Gateway Load Balancer - 2020 - GWLB
            Operate at layer 3(Network layer) - IP Protocol
