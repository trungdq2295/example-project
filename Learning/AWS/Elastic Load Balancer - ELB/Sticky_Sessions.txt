Sticky Sessions (Session Affinity)
    It is possible to implement stickiness so that the same client is always redirected to the same instance behind a load balancer
    This works for Classic Load Balancer, ALB, NLB
    The "cookie" used for stickiness has an expiration date you control
    Use case: make sure hte user doesn't lose his session data
    Enabling stickiness may bring imbalance to the load over the Backend EC2 instances
    Cookie Names:
        Application-based cookies
            Custom cookie
                Generated by the target
                Can include any custom attributes required by the application
                Cookie name must be specified individually for each target group
                Don't use AWSALB, AWSALBAPP, or AWSALBTG (reserved for use by the ELB)
            Application cookie
                Generated by the load balancer
                Cookie name is AWSALBAPP
        Duration-based Cookies
            Cookie generated by the load balancer
            Cookie name is AWSALB for ALB, AWSELB for CLB
