Application Load Balancer (v2)
    is Layer 7 in Network layer => HTTP
    Load balancing to multiple HTTP applications across machines (target groups)
    Load balancing to multiple applications on the same machines( ex: containers)
    Support for HTTP/2 and Websocket
    Support redirects( from HTTP to HTTPS for example)

    Routing tables to different target groups:
        Routing based on path in URL (example.com/users & example.com/posts)
        Routing based on hostname in URL (one.example.com & other.example.com)
        Routing based on Query String, Headers (example.com/users?id=123&order=false)

    ALB are a great fit for microservices & container-based application (example: Docker & Amazon ECS)
    Has a port mapping feature to redirect to a dynamic port in ECS

Target groups
    EC2 instances (can be managed by Auto scaling group) - HTTP
    ECS tasks ( managed by ECS itself) - HTTP
    Lambda functions - HTTP request is translated into a JSON event
    IP Address - must be private IPs
    ALB can route to multiple target groups
    Health check are at the target group level
    Good to know ALB
        Fixed hostname (xxx.region.elb.amazonaws.com)
        The application servers don't see the IP of the client directly
            The true IP of the client is inserted in the header X-Forwarded-For
            We can also get Port (X-Forwarded-Port) and proto (X-Forwarded-Proto)
    We can prevent other access EC2 instance after creating ALB by
        + Create ALB's own security group
        + Update inbound rule for HTTP from 0.0.0.0 to security group of ALB
