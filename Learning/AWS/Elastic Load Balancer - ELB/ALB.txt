Application Load Balancer (v2)
    is Layer 7 in Network layer => HTTP
    Load balancing to multiple HTTP applications across machines (target groups)
    Load balancing to multiple applications on the same machines( ex: containers)
    Support for HTTP/2 and Websocket
    Support redirects( from HTTP to HTTPS for example)

    Routing tables to different target groups:
        Routing based on path in URL (example.com/users & example.com/posts)
        Routing based on hostname in URL (one.example.com & other.example.com)
        Routing based on Query String, Headers (example.com/users?id=123&order=false)

    ALB are a great fit for micro services & container-based application (example: Docker & Amazon ECS)
    Has a port mapping  feature to redirect to a dynamic port in ECS

Target groups
    EC2 instances (can be managed by Auto scailing group) - HTTP
    ECS tasks ( managed by ECS itself) - HTTP
    Lambda functions - HTTP request is translated into a JSON event
    IP Address - must be private IPs

    ALB can rotue to multiple target groups
    Health check are at the target group level


 

    We can prevent other access EC2 intsance after creating ALB by 
        + Create ALB's own security group
        + Update inbound rule for HTTP from 0.0.0.0 to security group of ALB
