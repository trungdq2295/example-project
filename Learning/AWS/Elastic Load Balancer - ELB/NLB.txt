Network Load Balancer
    Network load balancer (Layer 4) allow to:
        Forward TCP & UDP traffic to your instances
        Handle millions of request per seconds
        Ultra-low latency
    NLB has one static IP per AZ, and support assigning Elastic IP (fixed IP)
    NLB are used for extreme performance, TCP or UDP traffic
    Not included in AWS free tier

    Target Groups
        EC2 instances
        IP Addresses - must be private IPs
        Application Load Balancer (NLB in front of ALB)
            We use this because:
                + With NLB, we can get the IP Address
                + With ALB, we can get all the rules of handling HTTP type traffic
        Health check support the TCP, HTTP and HTTPS Protocols
