Network Access Control List (NACL)
	NACL are like a firewall which control traffic from and to subnets
	Can have ALLOW and Deny Rules
	Are attached at subnet level
	One NACL per subnet, new subnets are assigned the default NACL
	You define NACL Rules:
		Rules have a number ( 1 - 32766), higher precedence with a lower number
		First rule match will drive the decision
			Example: if you define #100 ALLOW 10.0.0.10/32 and #200 DENY 10.0.0.10/32, the IP address iwll be allowed because 100 has a higher precedence over 200
		The last rule is an asterisk (*0 and deinies a request in case of no rule match
		AWS recommends adding rules by increment of 100
	Newly created NACLS will deny everything
	NACL are a great way of blocking a specific IP address at the subnet level
	
Default NACL
	Accepts everything inbound/outbound with the subnets it's associated with
	Do NOT modify the Default NACL, instead create custom NACLS
	
Ephemeral Ports
	For any two endpoints to establish a connection, they must use ports
	Clients connect to a defined port, and expect a response on an ephemeral port
	Different Operating Systems use different port ranges, examples:
		IANA & MS Windows 10 ( from 49152 - 65355)
		Many Linux Kernels - From 32768 - 60999
