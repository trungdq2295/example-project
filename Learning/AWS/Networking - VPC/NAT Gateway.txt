NAT Gateway
	AWS-managed NAT, higher bandwidth, high availability, no administration
	Pay per hour for usage and bandwidth
	NATGW is created in a specific Availability Zone, uses an Elastic IP
	Can't be used by EC2 instance in the same subnet (only from other subnets)
	Requires an IGW ( Private Subnet => NATGW => IGW)
	5 Gbps of bandwidth with automatic scaling up to 100 Gbps
	No security groups to managed /required
	
	NAT Gateway is resilient within a single availability zone
	Must create multiple NAT gateway in multiple AZs for fault-tolerance
	There is no cross-AZ fail over needed because if an AZ goes down it doesn't need NAT
