IPv6
	Ipv4 deisgned to provide 4.3 Billion addresses (they'll be exhausted soon) 
	IPv6 is the successor of Ipv4 
	IPv6 is designed to provide 3.4 * 10^38 unique IP addresses 
	Every IPv6 addresses is public and internet-routable ( no private range) 
	Format -> x.x.x.x.x.x.x.x

Ipv6 in VPC
	IPv4 cannot be disabled for your VPC and subnets 
	You can enable IPv6 (they're public IP addresses) to operate in dual-stack mode 
	Your EC2 instancces will get a least a private internal Ipv4 and a public IPv6  
	THey can communicate using either Ipv6 or Ipv6 to the internet through an Interget Gateway

IPv6 Troubleshooting VPC
	IPv4 cannot be disabled for your VPC and subnets 
	So, if you can not launch an EC2 instance in your subnet 
		It's not because it cannot acquire an Ipv6 ( the space is veryr large) 
		It's because there are no available IPv4 in your subnet 
	Solution: create new Ipv4 CIDR in your subnet
