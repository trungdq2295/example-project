Bastion Hosts
	We can use Bastion host to SSH into our private EC2 instances
	The bastion is in th public subnet which is then connected to all other private subnets
	Bastion Host security group muts allow inbound from the internet on port 22 from restricted CIDR, for example the public CIDR of your corporation
	Security Group of the EC2 instances must allow the Security Group of the Bastion Host, or the private IP of the Bastion host
	
	Example: instead of ssh to ur private EC2, you will SSH into EC2 Bastion Hosts and it will direct to your private EC2
