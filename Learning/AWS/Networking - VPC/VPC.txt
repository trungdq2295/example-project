VPC
	VPC = Virtual Private Cloud
	All new AWS accounts have a default VPC
	NEW EC2 instances are launched into the default VPC if no subnet is specified
	Default VPC has Internet connectivity annd all EC2 instances inside it have public IPv4 Address
	We also get a public and private Ipv4 DNS names
	
	You can have multiple VPCs in an AWS region ( max. 5 per region - soft limit)
	Max  CIDR per VPC is 5 , for each CIDR:
		Min size is /28(16 IP addresses)
		Max size is /16 (65536 IP addresses)
	Because VPC is private, only the private Ipv$ ranges are alloed:
		10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 (10.0.0.0/8)
		172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 (172.16.0.0/12)
		192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 ( 192.168.0.0/8)
	YourVPC CIDR should not overlap with oyur other networks
