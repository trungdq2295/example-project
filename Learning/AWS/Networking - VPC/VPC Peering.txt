VPC Peering
	Privately connect two VPCs using AWS' network
	Make them behave as if they were in the same network
	Must not have overlapping CIDRs
	VPC Peering connection is NOT transitive (must be established for each VPC that need to communicate with one another)
	You must update route tables in each VPC's subnet to ensure EC2 instance can communicate with each other
	
	You can create VPC Peering connection between VPCs in different AWS account/regions
	You can reference a security group in peered VPC (works cross accounts - same region)
