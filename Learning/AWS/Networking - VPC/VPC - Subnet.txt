VPC - Subnet (IPv4)
	AWS reserves 5 IP addresses (first 4 & last 1 ) in each subnet
	These 5 IP addresses are not available for use and can't be asigned to an EC2 instance
	Example: if CIDR block 10.0.0.0/24 then reserved IP addresses are:
		10.0.0.0 - Network Address
		10.0.0.1 - reserved by AWS for the VPC router
		10.0.0.2 - reserved by AWS for mapping to Amazon-provided DNS
		10.0.0.3 - reserved by AWS for future use
		10.0.0.255 - Network Broadcast Address. AWS does not support broadcast in VPC, therefore the addresses is reserved
	
	Exam Tips: if you need 29 IP addresses for EC2 instances
		You can't choose a subnet of size /27 (32 IP addressed, 32 - 5= 27 < 29)
		You need to choose a subnet of size /26 (64 IP addressed, 64 - 5 = 59 > 29)
