Internet Gateway (IGW)
	Allows resources (e.g., EC2 instances) in a VPC connect to the internet (outside of the AWS)
	It scales horizontally and is highly available and redundant
	Must be created separately from a VPC
	One VPC can only be attached to one IGW and vice versa
	Internet Gateways on their own do not allow Internet access
	Route tales must also be edited
