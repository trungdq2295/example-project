VPC Endpoints ( AWS PrivateLink)
	Every AWS service is publicly exposed (public URL)
	VPC Endpoints (powered by AWS PrivateLink) allows you to connect to AWS services using a private network instead of using the public internet
	They're redundant and scale horizontally
	They remove the need of IGW, NATGW, ... to access AWS services
	In case of issues:
		Check DNs Setting Resolution in your VPC

Type of Endpoints

Gateway or Interface Endpoints for S3?
	Gateway is most likely going to be preferred all the time at the exam
	Cost: free for Gateway, $ for interface endpoint
	Interface Endpoints is preferred access is required from on-premises (Site to Site VPN or Direct Connect), a different VPC or a different region
