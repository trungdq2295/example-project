AWS Lambda - Asynchronous Invocations
    The events are placed in an Event Queue
    Lambda function will read even from that Event Queue
    Lambda attempts to retry on errors
        3 tries to tal
        1 minute wait after 1st, then 2 minutes wait
    Make sure the processing is idempotent ( in case of retries)
    If function is retried, you will see duplicate logs entries in CloudWatch Logs
    Can define a DLQ - SNS or SQS - for failed process (need correct IAM permissions)
    Asynchronous invocations allow you to speed up the process if you don't need to wait for the result
    Services are done asynchronously
