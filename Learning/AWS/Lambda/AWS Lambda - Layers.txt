AWS Lambda - Layers
    Custom Runtimes
    Externalize Dependencies to re-use them:
        When you deploy your lambda function and it attached external dependencies and they're rarely changed
        So the idea is instead of deploying all of your zip file ( which is very large like upto 30MB)
        then you use lambda layers for your external dependencies to minimize the zip file
