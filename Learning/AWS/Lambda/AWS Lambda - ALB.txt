AWS Lambda - ALB
    To expose a Lambda function as HTTP(s) endpoint ..
    You can use Application Load Balancer (or an API Gateway)
    The lambda function must be registered in a target group

    How ALB convert the request from ALB to Lambda?
        ALB to Lambda: HTTP to JSON
            convert to json file (key,value)
        Lambda to ALB conversion: JSON to HTTP
            convert to http style like statusCode, headers, body,..

    ALB Multi-Value Headers
        can support multi-value headers (alb setting)
        When you enable multi-value headers, HTTP headers and query string parameters that are sent with multiple values ares shown as arrays within the AWS Lambda event and object
        For example:
            Requests HTTP will have query param like this
                http://example.com/path?name=foo&name=bar
            Instead of overring the name param, it will convert into an array when parsing to JSON to forward to Lambda
                "queryStringParameters": {"name":["foo","bar]}
