AWS Lambda - VPC
    By default, your Lambda function is launched outside your own VPC ( in an AWS-owned VPC)
    Therefore it cannot access resource in your VPC (RDS, ElastiCache, internal ELB..)

    VPC in Lambda
        You must define the VPC ID, the Subnets and the security groups
        Lambda will create an ENI (Elastic Network Interface) in your subnets

    Internet Access
        A lambda function in your VPC does not have internet access
        Important: Deploying a Lambda function in a public subnet does not give it internet access or a public IP
        Deploying a Lambda function in a private subnet gives it internet access if you have a NAT Gateway/ instance
        You can use VPC endpoints privately access AWS services without a NAT
