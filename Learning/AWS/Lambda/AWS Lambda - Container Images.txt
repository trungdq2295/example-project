AWS Lambda - Container Images
     Deploy Lambda function as container images of up to 10GB from ECR
     Pack complex dependencies, large dependencies in a container
     You package your lambda as image container and run the container in lambda runtime api
     Can create your own images as long as it implements the Lambda Runtime API
     Test the containers locally using Lambda Runtime Interface Emulator
     Unified workflow to build apps
     Best practices:
        Strategies for optimizing container images
            Use AWS-provided Base Images
                Stable, Built on Amazon Linux 2, cached by Lambda service
            Use Multi-STage Builds
                Build your code in larger preliminary images
                You only copy the artifacts you need in your final container images
                discard te preliminary steps
            Build from Stable to Frequently Changing
                Make your most frequently occurring changes as late in your Dockerfile as possible
            Use a single Repository for Function with Large Layer
                ECR compares each layer of a container image when it is pushed to avoid uploading and storing duplicates
            Use them
        Use container images to upload large Lambda function (up to 10GBs)
