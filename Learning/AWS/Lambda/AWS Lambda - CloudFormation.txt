AWS Lambda - CloudFormation
    Inline
        Inline functions are very simple
            You just need to include lambda code inside CloudFormation template
        Use the Code.ZIP file property
        You cannot include function dependencies with inline functions
    Through S3
        Store the Lambda function zip in S3
        you must refer the S3 zip location in the Cloudformation code
            S3Bucket
            S3Key: full path to zip
            S3ObjectVersion: if versioned bucket (recommend option)
        If you update the code in S3, but don't update S3bucket, S3Key or S3Objectversion, Cloudformation won't update your function
            That's why you need to enable versioning, so cloudformation can detect the change in S3
    through S3 Multiple Accounts
        You have S3 bucket with Lambda code in account 1 and your lambda function is in account 2 and account 3
            You need to provide bucket policy (allow & get list to s3 bucket) to cloudformation on account 2 and account 3
            So cloudformation can detect the change from S3 in account S1
