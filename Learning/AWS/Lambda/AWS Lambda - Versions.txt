AWS Lambda - Versions
    When you work on a Lambda function, we work on $LATEST
    When we're ready to publish a Lambda function, we create a version
    Version are immutable
    Versions have increasing version numbers
    Version get their own ARN (amazon resource name)
    Version = code + configuration (nothing can be changed - immutable)
    Each version of the lambda function can be accessed

    Lambda Aliases
        are "pointers" to lambda function versions
        We can define a "dev", "test", "prod" aliases and have them point at different lambda version
        Aliases are mutable
        Aliases enable Canary deployment by assigning weights to Lambda function
        Aliases have their own ARNs
        Aliases cannot reference aliases
