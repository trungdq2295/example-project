AWS Lambda - Dependencies
    If your lambda function depends on external libraries:
        You need to install the packages alongside your code and zip it together
    Upload the zip straight to Lambda if less than 50MB,
        else you have to upload to S3 first
    Native libraries work: they need to be compiled on Amazon Linux
    AWS SDK comes by default with every Lambda function
        So if you code includes AWS SDK, you don't need to do anything
