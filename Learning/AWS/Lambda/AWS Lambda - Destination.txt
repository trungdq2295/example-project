AWS Lambda - Destination
    New features:
        Can config to send result to a destination
    Asynchronous invocation - can define destination for successfully and failed event:
        SQS
        SNS
        Lambda
        EventBridge bus
    Note: AWS recommends you use destinations instead of DLQ now (but both can be used at same time)
        because DLQ only for failed event, but destination is for both successfully and failed
    Event Source mapping: for discarded event batches
        SQS
        SNS
    Note you can send events to a DLQ directly from SQS
