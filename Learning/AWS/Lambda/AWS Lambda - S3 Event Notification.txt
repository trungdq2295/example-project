AWS Lambda - S3 Event Notification
    Listen to those event of S3
        S3:ObjectCreated, S3:ObjectRemoved, S3:ObjectRestore, S3:Replication,..
    Use case:
        Object name filtering possible (*.jpg)
        Generate thumbnails of images uploaded to S3
    S# event notification typical deliver events in seconds but can sometimes take a minute or longer
    If two writes are made to a single non-version object at same time, it is possible that only a single event notification will be sent
        => make sure you enable versioning in S3
            so you can ensure that an event notification is sent for every successful write
