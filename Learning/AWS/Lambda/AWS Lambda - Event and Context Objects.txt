        Contains information from the invoking service (e.g: EventBridge)
        Lambda runtime converts the event to an object (e.g, dict type in python)
        Example: input arguments, invoking service arguments...
    Context Object
        Provides methods and properties that provide information about the invocation, function, and runtime environment
        Passed to your function by Lambda at runtime
        Example: aws_request_id, function_name, memory_limit_in_mb,...
