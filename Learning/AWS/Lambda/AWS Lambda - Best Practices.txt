AWS Lambda - Best Practices
    Perform heavy-duty work outside your function handler
        Connect to databases outside your function handler
        Initialize the AWS SDK outside your function handler
        Pull in dependencies or datasets outside of your function handler
    Use environment variables for:
        Database Connection Strings, S3 bucket, etc... don't put these values in your code
        Passwords, sensitives values.. they can be encrypted using KMS
    Minimizes your deployment package size to its runtime necessities
        Break down the function if need be
        Remember the AWS Lambda limits
        Use Layers where necessary
    Avoid using recursive code, never have a Lambda function call itself
