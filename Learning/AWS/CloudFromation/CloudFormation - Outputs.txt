CloudFormation - Outputs
    The outputs section declares optional output values that we can import onto other stack (if you export them first)
    You can also view the outputs in the AWS Console or in using the AWS CLI
    They're very useful for example if you define network CloudFormation, and output the variables such as VPC ID and your Subnet Ids
    It's the best way to perform some collaboration cross stack, as you let expert handle their own part of the stack
