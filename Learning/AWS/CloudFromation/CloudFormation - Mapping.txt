CloudFormation - Mapping
    Mappings are fixed variables within your CloudFormation template
    They're very handy to differentiate between environments (dev vs prod), regions (AWS regions), AMI types...
    All the values are hardcoded within the template
    Access Mapping Values
        Use Fn::FindInMap to return a named value from specific key
        !FindInMap [MapName, TopLevelKey, SecondLevelKey]
    When to use Mappings vs Parameters?
        Mappings are great when you know in advance all the values that can be taken and that they can be deduced from variable such as
            Region
            Availability Zone
            AWS Account
            Environment(dev vs prod)
            etc..
        They allow safer control over the template
        Use parameters when the values are really user specific
