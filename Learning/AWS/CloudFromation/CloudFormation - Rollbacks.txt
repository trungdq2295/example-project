CloudFormation - Rollbacks
    Stack Creation fails:
        Default: everything rolls back (gets deleted). We can look at the log
        Option to disable rollback and troubleshoot what happened
    Stack Update fails:
        The stack automatically rolls back to the previous known working state
        Ability to see in the log what happened and error messages
    Rollback Failure? Fix resources manually then issue ContinueUpdateRollbackAPI from Console
        Or from the CLI using continue-update-rollback API call
