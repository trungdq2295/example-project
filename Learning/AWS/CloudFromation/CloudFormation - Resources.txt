CloudFormation - Resources
    Resources are the core of your CloudFormation template (MANDATORY)
    They represent the different AWS Components that will be created and configured
    Resources are declared and can reference each other
    AWS figures out creation, updates and deletes resources for us
    There are over 700 types of resources (!)
    Resource types identifiers are of the form:
        service-provider:service-name:data-type-name
    You can view a list here
        https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-template-resource-type-ref.html
    you can create a dynamic number of resources
