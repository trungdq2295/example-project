CloudFormation - Conditions
    Conditions are used to control the creation of resources or output based on a condition
    Conditions can be whatever you want them to be, but common ones are:
        Environment (dev/test/prod)
        AWS Region
        Any parameter value
    Each condition can reference another condition, parameter value or mapping
    The logical ID is for you to choose. It's how you name condition
    The intrinsic function (logical) can be any of the following:
        Fn::And
        Fn::Equals
        Fn::If
        Fn::Not
        Fn::Or
    Conditions can be applied to resources/ outputs/ etc...
