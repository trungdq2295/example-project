RDS Read Replica
	Up to 15 read replicas
	Read replica can be within AZ, cross AZ or cross region
	Replication is Async, so read eventually consistent
	Replicas can be promoted to their own DB
	Applications must update the connection string to leverage read replica
	
	Use cases
		You have production database that is taking on normal load
		You want to run a reporting application to run some analytics
		You create  a Read replica to run  the new workload there
		The production application is unaffected
		Read replicas are used for SELECT (read) only kind statements ( not  INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
	
	Network Cost
		In AWS, there's network cost when data goes from one AZ to anothe
		For RDS Read Replica within the same regions, you don't pay that fee
		Example: 
			Data goes from DB main us-east-1a to DB read replicas us-east-1b (Same Region) = no cost
			Data goes from DB main us-east-1a to DB read replicas us-west-1b  (Cross Region) = charge $$
		
	RDS Multi AZ (Disaster Recovery)
		SYNC Replication
		One DNS name - automatic app failover to standby
			Mean: Client only need to care the DNS name to connect, AWS will proxy it to master db or to read replica if master db is down
		Increase availability 
		Failover in case of loss of AZ, loss of network, instance or storage failure
		No need manual intervention of apps
		Not used for scaling
		The read replicas can be setup as Multi AZ for Disaster Recovery(DR)
	
	From Single AZ to multi AZ
		Zero downtime operation ( no need to stop DB)
		The following happens internally:
			A snapshot is taken if the master DB is down
			A new DB is restored  from the snapshot in a new AZ
			Synchronization is established between 2 database
