        You can request a service limit increase by opening a ticket
        You can request a service quota increase by using the Service Quotas API
    Exponential Backoff (any AWS Service)
        If you get ThrottlingException (due to many API calls), use exponential backoff
        Retry mechanism already included AWS SDK API calls
        Must implement yourself if using AWS API as-is or in specific cases
            Only implement the retries on 5xx server errors and throttling
            Do not implement on the 4xx client errors
