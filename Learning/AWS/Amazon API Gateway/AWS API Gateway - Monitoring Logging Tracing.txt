AWS API Gateway - Monitoring Logging Tracing.txt
  CloudWatch Logs
    Log contains information request/response body
    Enable CloudWatch logging at the Stage level ( with Log level - ERROR, DEBUG, INFO)
    Can override settings a per API basis
  X-Ray
    Enable tracing to get extra information about requests in API Gateway
    X-Ray API Gateway + AWS Lambdas give you the full picture
  CloudWatch Metrics
    Metrics are by stages, Possibility to enable detailed metrics
    CacheHitCount & CacheMissCount: efficiency of the cache
    Count: Thet total number API requests in a given period
    Integration Latency: The time between when API Gateway relays a requests to the backend and when it receives a response from the backend
    Latency: the time between API Gateway receives a request from a client and when it returns a response to the client. The latency includes the integration latency and other API Gateway overhead
    4xxError (client-side) and 5xxError(server-side)
  API Gateway Throttling
    Account Limit
      API Gateway throttles requests at 10,000 rps across all API
      Soft limit that can be increased upon request
    In case of throttling => 429 too many requests (retriable error)
    Can set Stage limit & method limits to improve performance
    Or you can define Usage Plans to throttle per customer
    Just like Lambda concurrency, one API that is overloaded, if not limited, can cause other APIs to be throttled
  API Gateway Errors
