      API Gateway returns a response without send the request to backend
    HTTP/AWS (lambda & AWS Services)
      you must configure both the integration request and integration response
      Setup data mapping using mapping templates for the request & response
    AWS_Proxy (Lambda Proxy):
      incoming request from the client is the input to Lambda
      THe function is responsible for the logic request/response
      No mapping template, headers, query string parameters .. are passed as arguments
    HTTP_PROXY
      No mapping template
      The HTTP request is passed to the backend
      The HTTP response from the backend is forwarded by API Gateway
      possibility to add HTTP headers if need (ex: API key)

    filter output results (remove unnecessary/secured data)
    Content-Type can be set to application/json or application/xml
    How to integrate with SOAP API through API Gateway
      API Gateway should:
        Extract data from the request: either path, payload or header
        Build SOAP message based on request data (mapping template)
        Call SOAP service and receive XML response
        Transform XML response to desired format (like JSON), and response to the user
