AWS API Gateway - Security
  IAM Permissions
    Create an IAM  policy authorization and attach to User /Role
    Authentication = IAM |
    Authorization = IAM Policy
    Good to provide access within AWS (EC2, Lambda, IAM users,...)
    Leverage "Sig v4" capability where IAM credential are in headers
    So the idea is:
      When client make a RestAPI call to API Gateway with header SigV4
      API Gateway will know how to decrypt them and then call to IAM to check if user is authenticated
      So when it done, API Gateway will call to Lambda to get response and then response back to client
  Resource Policies
    similar to Lambda Resource Policy
    Allow for Cross Account Access(combined with IAM Security)
    Allow for a specific source IP address
    Allow for a VPC Endpoint
  Cognito User Pools
    Cognito fully manages user life cycle, token expires automatically
    API Gateway verifies identity automatically from AWS Cognito
    No custom implementation required
    Authentication = Cognito User Pools
    Authorization = API Gateway Methods
    The idea is:
      The client will authenticate by calling to Cognito User Pools and retrieve token
      And then the client will call API Gateway with token
      And API Gateway will verify the token by calling to Cognito
      And API Gateway will call to Lambda for the response for the client
  Lambda Authorizer (formerly Custom Authorizers)
    Token-based authorizer (bearer token) - ex JWT
    A request parameter-based Lambda authorizer ( headers, query string, stage var)
    Lambda must return an IAM policy for the user, result policy is cached
    Authentication = External
    Authorization = Lambda function
    The idea is the same as Cognito User Pool but using 3rd party for retrieve token
      and API Gateway will call to Lambda Authorizer and Lambda authorizer will call to 3rd party to verify token
      and then the same as the other

  Summary
    IAM:
      Great for users/ roles already within your AWS account, + resource policy for cross account
      Handle authentication + authorization
      Leverages Signature v4
    Custom Authorizer:
      Great for 3rd party token
      Very flexible in terms of what IAM policy is returned
      Handle Authentication verification + authorization in the Lambda function
      Pay per Lambda invocation, results are cached
    Cognito User Pool:
      you manage your own user pool ( can be backed by FB, GG login etc...)
      no need to write any custom code
      Must implement authorization in the backend
