AWS API Gateway - Caching
    Cache the response to reduce the number of calls made to the backend
    Default TTL is 300seconds (min: 0s, max 3600s)
    Caches are defined per stage
      So if you have many stages in your API Gateway, you need to define many caches for them
    Possible to override cache setting per method
    Cache encryption option
    Cache capacity between 0.5GB to 237GB
    Cache is very expensive, make sense in product but not in dev/test
    How we invalidate the cache
      Abel to flush the entire cache (invalidate it )immediately
      Clients can invalidate the cache with header: Cache-Control: max-age = 0 ( with proper IAM authorization)
      If you don't impose an InvalidateCache policy (or choose the Require authorization check box in the console), any client can invalidate the API cache
