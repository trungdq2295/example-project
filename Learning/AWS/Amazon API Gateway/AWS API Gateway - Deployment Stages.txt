AWS API Gateway - Deployment Stages
  Making changes in the API Gateway does not mean they're effective
  You need to make a "deployment" for them to be in effect
  It's a common source of confusion
  Changes are deployed to "Stages" (as many as you want)
  Use the naming you like for stages (dev, test ,prod)
  Each stage has it own configuration parameters
  Stages can be rolled back as a history of deployments is kept

  Stage Variables
    stage variables are like environment variables for API Gateway
    Use them to change often changing configuration values
    THey can be used in:
      Lambda function ARN
      HTTP endpoint
      Parameter mapping templates
    Use cases:
      Configure HTTP endpoints your stages talk to (dev, test, prod...)
      Pass configuration parameters to AWS Lambda through mapping templates
    Stage variables are passed to the "context" object in AWS Lambda
    Format: ${stageVariables.variableName}
  Stage Variables & Lambda Aliases
    We create a stage variable to indicate the corresponding Lambda alias
    Our API gateway will automatically invoke the right Lambda function
