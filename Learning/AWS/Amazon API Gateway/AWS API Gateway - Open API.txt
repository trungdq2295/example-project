  Request Validation
    You can configure API Gateway to perform basic validation of an API request before proceeding with the integration request
    When the validation fails, API Gateway immediately fails the request
      Return a 400-error response to the caller
    This reduces unnecessary calls to the backend
    Checks:
      The required request parameters in the URI, query string, and headers of an incoming request are included and non-blank
      the applicable request payload adheres to the configured JSON schema request model of the method
    Setup request validation by importing OpenAPi definitions file
