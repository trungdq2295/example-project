AWS API Gateway - Websocket
  API Gateway does support Websocket for client to keep sending message to server
  However, the callback is quite different. It's not the same as tradition websocket
    But API Gateway provide a callback url so the client listen on the callback url and get the response from server
  Routing
    Incoming JSON messages are routed to different backend
    If no routes => sent to $default
    You request a route selection expression to select the field on JSON to route from
      Example:
      {
        "service":"chat",
        "action":"join", // this as a key to route
        "data":{
          "room":"room1234"
        }
      }
    Sample expression: $request.body.action
    The result is evaluated against the route keys available in your API Gateway
    The route is then connected to the backend you've setup through API Gateway
