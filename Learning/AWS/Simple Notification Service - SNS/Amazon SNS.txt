Amazon SNS
	The "event producer" only sends message to one SNS topic
	As many "event receivers" (subscriptions) as we want to liste nto the SNS topic notifications
	Each subscriber to the topic will get all the messages (note: new feature to filter message)
	Up to 12,500,000 subscriptions per topic
	100,000 topic limits
	Many AWS services can send data directly to SNS for notifications
