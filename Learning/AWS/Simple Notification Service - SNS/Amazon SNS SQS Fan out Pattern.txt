Amazon SNS + SQS : Fan out Pattern
	Push once in SNS, receive in all SQS queues that are subscribers
	Fully decoupled, no data loss
	SQS allows for: data persistence, delayed processing and retries of work
	Ability to add more SQS subscribers over time
	Make sure your SQS queue access policy allows for SNS to write
	Cross-Region Delivery: works with SQS queues in other regions

Example: 
	Application: S3 Events to multiple queues	
		For the same combination of: event type ( e.g object create/update) and prefix (e.g images/**) you can only have one S3 event rule
		If you want to send the same S3 event to man SQS queue, use fan-out pattern
	
	Application: SNS to Amazon S3 through Kinesis Data Firehose
		SNS can send to Kinesis and therefore we can have the following solutions architecture:

Amazon SNS - FIFO topic
	FIFO = First In First Out (ordering of messages in the topic)
	Similar features as SQS FIFO
		Ordering by Message Group ID ( all messages in the same group are ordered)
		Deduplication using a Deduplication ID or Content based Deduplication
	
	Can only have SQS FIFO queue as subscribers
	Limited ThroughPut

SNS - Messages filtering
	JSON policy used to filter messages sent to SNS topic' subscriptions
	If a subscription doesn 't have a filter policy, it receives every messages
