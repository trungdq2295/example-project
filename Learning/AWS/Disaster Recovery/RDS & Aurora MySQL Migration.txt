RDS & Aurora MySQL Migration
	RDS MySQl to Aurora MySQL
		Option 1: DB Snapshots from RDS MYSQL restore as a MySQL Aurora ( got downtime from RDS MYSQL due to stop it to make snapshots)
		Option 2: Create an Aurora Read Replica from your RDS MySQL, and when the replication lag is 0, promote it as its own DB cluster(can take time and cost $)
	External MySQL to Aurora MySQL	
		Option 1:
			Use Percona XtraBackup to creat a file backup in Amazon S3
			Create an Aurora MySQL DB from Amazon S3
		Option 2:
			Create an Aurora MySQL DB
			Use the mysqldump utility to migrate MySQL into Aurora (slower than S3 method)
	Use DMS if both databases are up and running
