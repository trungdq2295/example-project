Transferring large amount of data into AWS
	Example: Transfer 200TB of data in the cloud and we have only 100Mbps internet connection
	Solutions: 
		Over the internet/ Site-to-Site VPN
			Immediate set up
			Will take 200 (TB) *1000(GB)*1000(MB)*8(b)/ 100 Mbps  = 16,000,000 = 185days
		Over direct connect 1Gbps
			Long for the one-time setup(over a month)
			Will take 200 (TB) *1000(GB)*1000(MB)*8(b)/ 1 Gbps  = 1,600,000 = 18.5days
		Over Snowball:
			Will take 2 to 3 snowballs in parallel
			Takes about 1 week for the end-to-end transfer
			Can be combined with DMS
		For on-going replication/ transfer: Site-to-Site VPN or Dx with Snowball or DataSync
