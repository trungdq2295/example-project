RDS Backup
	Automated Backup
		Daily full	backup of database (during the backup window)
		Transaction logs are backed-up by RDS every 5 minutes => ability to restore to any point of time (from oldest backup to 5 minutes ago)
		1 to 35 days retentions, set 0 to disbaled
	Manual DB Snapshots
		Manually triggered by the user
		Retention of backup as long as you want
	Trick: in a stopped DB, you will still pay for storage. if you plan on stopping it for a while, create a snapshot and restore instead
