Aurora Custom Endpoints 
	Define a subset of Aurora instances  as a custom endpoint
		Example: there're some read replicas which has higher resource than other and we want our client to read data from them so we create a custom endpoint to access it
	
	The reader endpoint is generally not used after defining custom endpoint
