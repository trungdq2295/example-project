Amazon Aurora
	proprietary technology from AWS ( not open sourced)
	Postgres and MySQL are both supported as an Aurora DB (that means your driver will work as if Aurora was a Postgres or MySQL)
	Aurora is an "AWS cloud optimized" and claims 5x performance improvement over MySQL on RDS, over 3x the performance on Postgres on RDS
	Aurora storage automatically grows in increment of 10GB, up to 128TB
	Aurora can have up to 15 replicas and the replication process is faster than MySQL(sub 10 ms replica lag)
	Failover in Aurora is instantaneous. It's high availability  native.
	Aurora cost more than RDS (20% more) - it's more efficient
	
	Aurora High Availability and Read Scaling
		6 copies of your data across 3 AZ ( means everytime you write a data, Aurora will create 6 copies of it across 3 Az, 2 copies in each AZ):
			only need 4 copies available of 6 needed for write
			only need 3 copies available of 6 needed for read
			Self healing with peer-to-peer replication
			Storage is striped across 100s of volumes
		One Aurora Instance takes write (master)
		Automated failover  for master less than 30seconds
		Master+ up to  15 Aurora read Replicas serve reads
		Support for Cross Region Replication
		Support Auto Scaling
		
	Aurora DB Cluster
		Writer Endpoint
			the endpoint client use to write data
		Reader Endpoint 
			It helps with connection of load balancing with Aurora read replicas
				So everytime client make connect to Read endpoint, it will load balance to read replica
	Features
		Automatic failover
		Backup and Recovery
		Isolation and security
		Industry compliance
		Push-button scaling
		Automated Patching with Zero Downtime
		Advanced Monitoring 
		Routine Maintenance
		Backtrack: restore data at any point of time without using backups => less storage for DB
