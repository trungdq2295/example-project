Amazon Aurora - Summary
	Compatible API for PostgreSQL/ MySQL, separation of storage and compute
	Storage: data is stored in 6 replicas, across 3 AZ - highly available, self -healing, auto-scaling
	Compute: Cluster of DB instance across multiple AZ, auto-scaling of Read Replicas
	Cluster: Custom endpoints for writer and reader DB instances
	Same security/ monitoring/ maintenance features as RDS
	Know the backup & restore options for Aurora
	Aurora Serverless- for unpredictable/ intermittent workloads, no capacity planning
	Aurora Multi-Master- for continuous writes fail over ( high write availability)
	Aurora Global: up to 16 DB REad Instances in each region, < 1 second storage replication
	Aurora Machine Learning: perform ML using SageMaker & Comprehend on Aurora
	Aurora Database Cloning: new cluster from existing one, faster than restoring a snapshot
	Use case: same as RDS, but with less maintenance/ more flexibility/ more performance/ more features
