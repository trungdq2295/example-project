Aurora Serverless
	Automated Database instantiation and auto-scaling based on usage
	Good for infrequent, intermitten or unpredictable workload
	No capacity planning needed
	Per per second, can be more cost-effective



Why we need it ?
    Your software development and QA teams are using databases during work hours, but don't need them on nights or weekends. With Aurora Serverless v1, your database automatically shuts down when not in use, and starts up much more quickly when work starts the next day.
