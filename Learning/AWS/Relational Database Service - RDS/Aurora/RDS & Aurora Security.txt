RDS & Aurora Security
	At-rest encryption:
		DB master & replicas encryptiong using AWS KMS - must be defined as launch time 
		If the master is not encrypted, the RR cannot be encrypted 
		To encrypt an un-encrypted DB, go through a DB snapshot & restore as encrypted
	In-flight encryption:
		TLS-ready by default mean client side need to use AWS TLS root certificate to access.
	IAM Authentication: 
		IAM roles to connect to your DB ( instead of username, pw)
			For example: you want ur EC2 instance to connect DB, it can connect to DB without giving proper username, password
	Security Groups: Control network access to ur RDS/ Aurora DB 
	No SSH available except on RDS custom 
	Audit Logs can be enabled and sent to CLoudWatch Logs for longer retention
