AWS Certificate Manager with API Gateway
	Edge-Optimized (default): For global clients
		REquests are routed through the CloudFront Edge locations (improves latency)
		The API Gateway still lives in only one
	Regional:
		For clients within the same region
		Could manually combine with CloudFront (more control oever the caching strategies and the distirbution)

		Can only be accessed from your VPC using an interface VPC endpoint (ENI)
		Use a resource policy to define access
