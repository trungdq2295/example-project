S3 Replication Encryption Consideration
	Unencrypted objects and objects encrypted with SSE-S3 are replciated by default
	Objects encrypted with SSE-C (customer provided key) are never replicated
	
	For objects encrypted with SSE-KMS, you need to enable the option
		Specify which KMS Key to encrypt the objects within the target bucket
		Adapt the KMS Key policy for the target key
		An IAM Role with KMS:Decrypt for the source KMS Key and kms:Encryrpt for the target KMS Key
		You might get KMS throttling errors, in wihch case you can ask for a Service Quotas increase
	
	You can use multi-region AWs KMs Keys, but they are currently treated as independent keys by Amazon S3 (the object will still be decrypted and then encrypted)
