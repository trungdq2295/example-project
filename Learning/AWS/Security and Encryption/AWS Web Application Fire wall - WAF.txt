AWS Web Application Fire wall - WAF
	Protects your web applications from common web exploits (Layer 7)
	Layer 7 is HTTP (vs Layer 4 is TCP/UDP)
	Deploy on
		Application Load Balancer
		API Gateway
		CloudFront
		AppSync GraphQL API
		Cognito User Pool
	
	Defiene WEB ACL (Web Access Control List) Rules:
		IP Set: up to 10,000 IP addresses - use -multiple Rules for more IPs
		HTTP headers, HTTP body, or URI strings Protects from common attack - SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
		Size constrants(size request), geo-match (block countries)
		Rate-based rules ( to count occurrences of events ) - for DDoS protection
	
	Web ACL are regional except for CloudFront
	A rule group is a reusable set of rules that you can add to a web ACL
	
	WAF does not support the Network Load Balancer
	WE can use Global Accelerator for fixed IP and WAF on the ALB
