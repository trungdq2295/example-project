IAM Roles vs Resource Based Policies
	Cross account:
		attaching a resource-based policy to a resource (example: S3 bucket policy)
		OR using a role as a proxy
	
	When you assume a role (user application or service), you give up your original permissions and take the permissions assigned to the role
	When using a resource-based policy, the principal doesn't have to give up his permissions
	Example: User in account A needs to scan a DynamoDB table in Account A and dump it in an S3 bucket in Account B
	Supported  by: Amazon S3 bucket, SNS topic, SQS queue, etc...

		When a rule runs, it needs permissions on the target 
		Resource-based policy: Lambda, SNS, SQS, CloudWatch Logs, API Gateway...
		IAM Role: Kinesis stream, System Manager Run Command, ECS task...
