Amazon DynamoDB - Indexes
  Local Secondary Index (LSI) -
    Similar Sort Key for your table (same Partition Key as that of base table)
    The sort key consists of one scalar attribute (String, Number, or Binary)
    Up to 5 Local Secondary Indexes per table
    Must be defined at table creation time
    Attribute Projections - can contain some or all the attributes of the base table (KEYS_ONLY, INCLUDE, ALL)
    Use cases: You want to query on the same partition but different sort key
  Global Secondary Index (GSI)
    Alternative Primary Key (HASH or HASH+ RANGE) from the base table
    Speed up queries on non-key attributes
    The Index Key consist of scalar attribute (String, Number, or Binary)
    Attribute Projections - some or all the attributes of the base table (KEYS_ONLY, INCLUDE, ALL)
    Must provisions RCUs & WCUs for the index
    can be added/modified after table creation
    Use cases: you want to query on different partition key(primary key)
  Indices and Throttling
    Global Secondary Index (GSI):
      If the writes are throttled on the GSI, then the main table will be throttled Even if the WCU on the main tables are fine
      Choose  your GSI partition key carefully
      Assign your WCU capacity carefully
    Local Secondary Index(LSI):
      Uses the WCUs and RCUs of the main table
      No special throttling considerations
