  Coordinated, all-or-nothing operation to multiple items across one or more tables,
  Provides ACID
  Read Modes - Eventual Consistency, Strong consistency, Transactional

    TransactGetItem - one or more GetItems operations
    TransactWriteItems - one or more PutItem, UpdateItem and DeleteItem operations

  Capacity Computations
    Example 1: 3 Transactional writes per seconds, with item size of 5KB
      2 * 3 * (5KB/1KB) = 30 WCUs
    Example 2: 5 Transaction reads per seconds, with item size of 5KB
      5 * 2 * (8KB/4KB) = @0 RCUs
