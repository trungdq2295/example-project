Amazon DynamoDB - Partition Strategies
  Write Sharding
    A situation we have a voting application with two candidates A and B ( such as USA President Election) and other candidate
    If partition key is candidate_id, this will result in hot partition since people will vote most A,b
    A good way to solve this is to add suffix/prefix to candidate_id
      It can be random suffix/prefix
      Or It can be calculated suffix/prefix
    Whatever methods suit you, you choose it
