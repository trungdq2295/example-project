Amazon DynamoDB
	Fully managed, highly available with replication across multiple AZs
	NoSQL database - not a relational database - with transaction support
	Scales to massive workloads, distributed database
	Millions of requests per seconds, trillions of row, 100s of TB of storage
	Fast and consistent in performance (single-digit millisecond) 
	Integrated with IAM for escurity, authorization and administration
	Low cost and auto-scaling capabilities
	No maintenance or patching, always available
	Standard & Infrequest Access (IA) Table Class

DynamoDB Basic
	DynamoDB is made of Tables
	Each table has a Primary Key ( must be deicded at creation time)
	Each table can have an infinite number of imtes( =rows)
	Each item has attributes ( can be added over time  - can be null)
	Maximum size of an item is 400KB
	Data types supported are:
		Scalar Types - String, Number, Binary, Boolean, Null
		Document Types - List, Map
		Set types - String set, Number Set, Binary Set
	Therefore, in DynamoDB you can rapidly evolve schema

DynamoDB - Read/Write Capacity Modes
	Control how you manage your table's capacity (read/write throughput)
	Provisioned Mode (default)
		You specify the number of reads/writes per seconds
		You need to plan capacity beforehand
		Pay for provisioned Read Capacity Units(RCU) & Write Capacity Units (WCU)
		Possibility to add auto-scaling mode for RCU & WCU 
		
	On-Demand Mode
		Read/writes automatically scale up/down with your workloads
		No capacity planning needed
		Pay for what you use, more expensive ($$$)
		Great for unpredictable workloads, steep sudden spikes
