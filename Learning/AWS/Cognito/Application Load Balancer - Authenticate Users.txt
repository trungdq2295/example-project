Application Load Balancer - Authenticate Users
  Your ALb can securely authenticate users
    Offload the work of authenticating users to your load balancer
    Your applications can focus on their business logic
  Authenticate users though:
    Identity Provider (IdP): OpenID Connect (OIDC) compliant
    Cognito User Pool:
      Social IdPs, such as Amazon, Facebook or Google
      Corporate identities using SAML, LDAP, or Microsoft AD
  Must use an HTTPS listener to set authenticate-oidc & authenticate-cognito rules
  OnUnauthenticatedRequest - we can do 3 options:
    authenticate (default): ask user to authenticate
    deny: deny request
    allow
  Auth through Cognito User Pools
    Create Cognito User Pool, Client and Domain
    Make sure an ID token is returned
    Add the social or Corporate ldP if needed
    Several URL redirections are necessary
    Allow your Cognito User Pool Domain on your ldP app's callback URL which will be redirected after successfully login
  ODIC Auth Flow
    This is quite complicated
      There will be a http request from client to ALB
      Then ALB's going to redirect the user for authentication to the authentication endpoint of your identity provider
      The Identity provider will grant user a "Authorization Code"
      Authorization code will be passed to ALB, which is going to send to Token Endpoint from Identity Provider
      The authorization code will be switched and exchanged for ID Token + Access Token
      And then ALB do the request to User Info Endpoint from Identity Provider with that Token to access user info
