Amazon Cognito - Identity Pools
  The issue is you have so many users who want to access AWS service temporary, so creating an IAM role for this kind of situation is not good
  Get identities for "users" so they obtain temporary AWS credentials
  Your identity pool (e.g identity source) can include:
    Public providers (Amazon, FB,GG,...)
    Users in an Amazon Cognito User pool
    OpenID Connect Providers & SAML Identity Provider
    Developer Authenticated Identities ( custom login servers)
    Cognito identity Pools allow for unauthenticated (guest) access
      => You can create Guest account for this kind
  After getting these credentials, users can then access AWS services directly or through API Gateway
    The IAM policies applied ot the credentials are defined in Cognito
    They can be customized based on the user_id for fine grained control
  Flow:
    Client login and get token
    Client exchange token with Cognito identity Pools
    Cognito identity pool will validate if token valid
    Cognito return temporary AWS credentials to client
    Client use temporary AWS credentials to connect AWS

  IAM Roles
    How cognito assign IAM Role to the user?
    We have to define default IAM roles for authenticated and guest users
    Default rules to choose the role for each used based on the user's ID
    you can partition your user's access using policy variables
    IAm credentials are obtained by Cognito identity Pools through STS ( AWS Security Token Service)
    The roles must have a "trust" policy of Cognito Identity Pools
