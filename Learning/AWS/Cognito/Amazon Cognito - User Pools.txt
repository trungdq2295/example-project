AWS - Cognito User Pools(CUP) - User Features
	Create a serverless database of user for your web & mobile apps
	Simple Login: Username (or email) / password combination
	Password reset
	Email & Phone Number Verification
	Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)
	federated identities: users from Facebook, GG, SAML...
	Feature: block users if their credentials are compromised elsewhere
	Login sends back a JWT
	CUP integrate with API Gateway and Application Load Balancer
	So the idea is the client will call to Cognito User Pools to get the token and call to APi Gateway/ALB
	  And then APi Gateway/ALB will call to Cognito User Pools to verify the token
	  If it's ok, then it will process it

  Lambda Trigger
    CUP can invoke a Lambda function synchronously on these trigger event:
      Authentication Events
      Sign-up
      Messages
      Token Creations
  Hosted Authentication UI
    Cognito has a hosted authentication UI that you can add to your app to handle sign-up and sign-in workflows
    Using the hosted UI, you have foundation for integration with social logins, OIDC or SAML
    Can customize with a custom logo and custom CSS
  Hosted UI Custom Domain
    For custom domains, you must create an ACM certificate in "us-east-1" no matter what your region is
    The custom domain must be defined in the "App Integration" section
  Adaptive Authentication
    Block sign-ins or require MFA if the login appears suspicious
    Cognito examines each sign-in attempt and generates a risk score (low, medium, high) for how likely the sign-in request is to be from malicious attacker
    Users are prompted for a second MFA only when risk is detected
    Risk score is based on different factors such as if the users has used the same device, location, or IP address
    Checks for compromised credentials, account takeover protection, and phone and email verification
