Signing AWS API Requests
    When you call the AWS HTTP API, you sign the request so that AWS can identify you, using your AWS credentials (access key & secret key)
    Note: some requests to Amazon S3 don't need to be signed
    If you use  the SDK or CLI, the HTTP request are signed for you
    You should sign an AWS HTTP request using Signature V4 (Sig V4)
    SigV4 Request Examples
        HTTP Header option ( signature in Authorization header)
        Query String options (request param) : Example S3-Presigned URL
