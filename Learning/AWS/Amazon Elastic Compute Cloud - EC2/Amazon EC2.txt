What is Amazon EC2?
	One of the most popular AWS's offering
	Stand for Elastic Compute Cloud = Infrastucture as a service
	Consist many thing
		Renting virtual machines (Ec2)
		Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
		Distributing load across machines (ELB)
		Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group (ASG)
		
	Knowing EC2 is fundamental to understand how the Cloud works

EC2 will change IP for its instance once it get restarted

EC2 Sizing and configuration options	
	Operating System (OS)
	How mcuh compute power and core( CPU)
	How much random-access memory (RAM)
	
Ec2 instance types: example
	Following naming convention: m5.2xlarge
		m: instance class
		5: generation
		2xlarge: size within the instance class
		
EC2 Instances Purchasing Options
	On-Demand Instance - short workload, predictable pricing, pay by second
		Pay for what you use
			Linux or Windows - billing per second, after the first minute
			All other OS - billing per hour
		Has the highest cost but no upfront payment
		No long-term commitment
		Recommended for short-term and un-interrupted workloads, where you cant predict how the application will behave
	Reserved Instance
		Up to 72% discount compared to ON-demand
		Payment Options - No Upfront, Partial Upfront, All Upfront
		Recommended for steady-state usage applications ( such as database)
	Saving Plans
		Discount based on long-term usage
		Commit to a certain type of usage ( $10/hour for 1 or 3 years)
		Usage beyond EC2 Savings Plans is billed at the On-Demand price
		Locked to a specific instance family & AWS region (M5 in us-east-1)
		Flexible across:
			Instace Size ( such as m5.xlarge, m5.2xlarge)
			OS ( Linux, WIndows)
			Tenancy (Host, Dedicated, Default)
	Spot Instances
		Can get discount up to 90%
		Instances that you can "lose" at any point of time if your max price is less than the current spot price
		The MOST cost-efficient instances in AWS
		Useful for workloads that are resilient to falure
			Batch jobs
			Data analysis
			Image processing
			Any distributed workloadsWorkloads with a flexible start and end time
		Not suitable for criticqal jobs or databases
	Dedicated Hosts
		A physical server with EC2 instance capacity full dedicated to your use
		Allows you address compiance requirements and use your existing server bound software license( per-socket, per-core, per-VM software licenses)
		Purchasing Options
			On-Demand - pay per second for active Dedicated Host
			Reserved - 1 or 3 years (No Upfront, Partial Upfront, All Upfront)
		Useful for software that have complicated licensing model (ByOL - Bring your Own License)
		Or for companies that have strong regulatory or copliance needs
	Dedicated Instances
		Instances run on hardware that's dedicated to you
		May share hardware with other instances in same account
		No control over instance placement( can move hardware after Stop/ Start)
	Capacity Reservations
		Reserve On-Demand instances capacity in a specific AZ for any duration
		You always have access to EC2 capacity when you need it
		No time commitment (create/cancel anytime), no billing discounts
		Combine with Regional Reserved Instances and SAvings Plans to benefit from billing discounts
		You're charged at On-Demand rate whether you run instances or not
		Suitable for short-term, uninterrupted workloads that needs to be in a speicfic AZ
		
		
General purpose:
	Great for a diversity of workloads such as web servers or code repositories
	Balance between:
		Compute (CPU)
		Memory (such as RAM)
		Networking

Security Groups:
	Can be attached to multiple EC2 instance
	Locked down to a region/VPC combination
	Its goood to maintain one separate security goup for SSH access
	If your application is not accessible (time out), then its a security group issue
	If your application gives a "connection refused" error, then its an appliocation error or its not launched
	All inbound traffic is blocked by default
	All outbound traffic is authorised by default
