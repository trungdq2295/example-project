Kinesis vs SQS Ordering
	Let's assume 100 trucks, 5 kinesis shards, 1 SQS FIFO
	Kinesis Data Streams
		On average you'll have 20 trucks per shards
		Trucks will have their data ordered within each shards
		The maximum amount of consumers in parallel we can have is 5
		Can receive up to 5MB/s of data
	SQS FIFO
		You only have 1 SQS FIFO queue
		you will have 100 group ID
		you can have up to 100 consumers(due to the 100 group ID)
		You have up to 300 messages per second  ( or 3000 if using batching)
