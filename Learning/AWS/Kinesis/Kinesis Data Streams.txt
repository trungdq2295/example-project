Kinesis Data Streams
	Retention between 1 day to 365 days
	Ability to reprocess (replay) data
	Once data is inserted in Kinesis, it can't be deleted (immutability)
	Data that shares the same partition goes to the same shard (ordering)
	Producers: AWS SDK, Kinesis Producer Library(KPL), Kinesis Agent
	Consumers:
		Write your own: Kinesis Client Library ( KCL), AWS SDK
		Managed: AWS Lambda, Kinesis Data Firehose, Kinesis DAta analytics
		
Capacity Modes:
	Provisioned Mode:
		you choose the number of shards provisioned, scale manually or using API
		Each shard gets 1MB/s in ( or 1 000 record per second)
		Each shard gets 2MB/s out ( classic or enhanced fan-out consumer)
		You pay per shard provisioned per hour
	On-demand mode:
		no need to provision or manage the capacity
		Default capacity provisioned ( 4MB/s in or 4000 records per second)
		Scales automatically based on observed throughput peak during the last 30 days
		Pay per stream per hour & data in/out per GB
Security
	Controll access/ authorization using IAM policies
	Encryption in flight using HTTPS endpoints
	Encryption at rest using KMS
	You can implement encryption/decryption of data on client side (harder)
	VPC endpoints available for Kinesis to access within VPC
	Monitor API calls using Cloud Trails
