CName & Alias
    AWS Resources (CloudFont, EC2, Load Balancer ... ) expose an AWS hostname and you want to map it to another hostname:
        lb1-1234.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com and you want myapp.mydomain.com 
    You can use:
    CNAME: 
        Points a hostname to any other hostname. (app.mydomain.com => blahblah.anything.com) 
        ONLY FOR NON ROOT DOMAIN (aka: something.mydomain.com, not working: mydomain.com)
    Alias: 
        Points a hostname to an AWS Resource (app.mydomain.com => blabla.amazonaws.com)
        Works for ROOT DOMAIN and NON ROOT DOMAIN (aka: mydomain.com and something.mydomain.com)
        Free of charge
