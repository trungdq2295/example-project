Rout 53 - Health Check
    HTTP Health check are only for public resources 
    Health Check => Automated DNS Failover: 
        1. Health checks that monitor and endpoint (application, server, other AWS resource) 
        2. Health checks that monitor other health check (Calculated Health Checks) 
        3. Health checks that monitor CloudWatch Alarms(full control!) - e.g: throttles of DynamoDB, alarms on RDS, custom metrics ... (helpful for private resources)
Health check - Monitor an Endpoint
    About 15 global Health checkers will check the endpoint health 
        Healthy/Unhealthty Threshold - 3 (default) 
        Interval - 30 sec (can set to 10 sec -higher cost) 
        Supported protocol: HTTP, HTTPS and TCP 
        If >18% of health checkers report the endpoint is healthy, Route 53 considers it Healthy. otherwise, it's unhealthy 
        Ability to choose which locations you want Route 53 to use 
    Health Checks pass only when the endpoint responds with the 2xx and 3xx status codes 
    Health Checks can be setup to pass/ failed based on the text in the first 5120 bytes of the response 
    Configure your router/firewall to allow incoming requests from Route 53 Health Checkers
Health Check - Calculated Health Check
    Combine the results of multiple health check into single health check
        Example: You have 3 EC2 instane and each instance has each own Health Check. There will be a parent Health check to combine result those Health check to check healthy or unhealthy
    You can use AND, OR, or NOT
    Can monitor up to 256 Child Health Checks 
    Specify how many of the health checks need to pass to make the parent pass 
    Usage: perform maintenance to your website without causing all health to checks to fail
Health Check - Private Hosted Zone
    Rotue 53 health checkers are outside the VPC 
    They cant access private endpoints (private VPC or on-premises resource) 
    You can create a CloudWatch Metric and associate a CloudWatch Alarm, then create a Health Check that checks the alarms itself
