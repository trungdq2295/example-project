    Route 53 - Records
        How you want to route traffic for a domain 
        Each record contains: 
            Domain/subDomain Name - eg: example. com 
            Record Type - Eg: A or AAAA 
            Value - e.g, 11.23.45.67 
            Routing Policy - how Route 53 responds to queries 
            TTL - amount of time the record cached at DNS Resolvers 
        Routes 53 supports the following DNS record types: 
            (must know) A/ AAAA/ CNAME/ NS 
            (advanced) CAA/ DS /MX /NAPTR/ PTR / SOA / TXT /SPF /SRV

    Route 53 - Record Type
        A - maps a hostname to IPv4 
        AAAA - maps a hostname to IPv6 
        CName- maps a hostname to another hostname 
            The target is a dommain name which must have an A or AAAA record 
            Cant' create a CName record for the top node of a DNS namespace( Zone Apex)
            Example: you can't create or example.com but you can create for www.example.com 
        NS - Name Servers for the Hosted Zone 
            Control how traffic is routed for a domain

    Route 53 - Hosted Zone
        A container for records that define how to route traffic to a domain and its subdomains 
        Public Hosted Zones - contains records that specify how to route traffic on the Internet (public domain names) 
            example: application1.mypublicdomain.com 
        Private Hosted Zones - contains records that specify how you route traffic within one or more VPCs ( private domain names) 
            example: application1.company.internal 
        You pay $0.50 per month per hosted zone
    Route 53 - Records TTL
        High TTL - e.g: 24 hrs 
            Less traffic on Routes 53 
            Possibly outdated records 
        Low TTL- e.g. 60secs 
        More traffic on Route 53 ($$) 
        Records are outdated for less time 
        Easy to change records 
    Except for Aliasa records, TTL is mandatory for each DNS records
