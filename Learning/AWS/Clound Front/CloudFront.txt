AWS CloudFront
    CDN
    Improves read performance, content is cached at the edge
        Example: our S3 in Australia, and a user from USA request a bucket
            Then user will be directed to the cloudfront at USA and CloudFront will be able to fetch content from Australia
            Same as China user, it will fetch data at China edge location
    Improves users experience
    216 Point of Presence globally (edge locations)
    DDoS protection (because worldwide), integration with Shield, AWS Web application Firewall

    Origins
        S3 bucket
            For distributing files and caching them at the edge
            Enhanced security with CloudFront Origin Access Control (OAC)
            OAC is replacing Origin Access Identity (OAI)
            CloudFront can be used as an ingress (to upload file to S3)
        Custom Origin (HTTP)
            ALB
            EC2 Instance
            S3 website (must first enable the bucket as a static S3 website)

    CloudFront vs S3 Cross Region Replication
        CloudFront:
            Global Edge Network
            Files are cached for a TTL (maybe a day)
            Great for static content must be available everywhere
        S3 Cross Region Replication:
            Must be setup for each region you want replication to happen
            Files are updated in near real-time
            Read only
            Great for dynamic content that needs to be available at low-latency in few regions
