CloudFront Caching
    The cache lives at each CloudFront Edge Location
    CloudFront identifies each object in the cache using Cache Key
    You want to maximize the Cache Hit ratio to minimize request to origin
    You can invalidate part of the cache using CreateInvalidation API

    CloudFront Cache Key
        A unique identifier for every object in the cache
        By default, consists of hostname + resource portion of the URL
        If you have an application that serves up content that varies based on user, device, language, location
        You can add other element (HTTP headers, cookies,..) to the Cache Key using CloudFront Cache Policies
    Cache Policy
        Cache based on:
            HTTP Headers: None - Whitelist
            Cookies: None - Whitelist - Include All-Except - ALL
            Query String: None - Whitelist - Include All-Except - ALL
        Control the TTL (0 second to 1 year), can be set by origin using the Cache-Control header, Expires header..
        Create your own policy or use Predefined managed Policies
        All HTTP headers, cookies, and  query strings that you include in the Cache Key are automatically included in origin requests

        Cache Policy HTTP Headers
            None:
                Don't include any header in the Cache Key
                Headers are not forwarded (except default)
                Best performance
            Whitelist:
                only specified headers included in the Cache Key
                Specified headers are also forwarded to Origin
        Cache Policy Query Strings
            None:
                Don't include any query strings in the Cache Key
                query strings are not forwarded
            Whitelist
                Only specified query strings included in the Cache Key
                Only specified query strings are forwarded
            Include All-Except
                Include all query strings in the Cache KEy except the specified list
                All query strings are forwarded except the specified list
            All
                Include all query strings in the Cache Key
                All query strings are forwarded
        Origin Request Policy
            Specify values that you want to include in origin request without including them in the Cache Key(no duplicated cached content)
            You can include
                HTTP headers: none - whitelist - all viewer headers option
                cookies: none - whitelist - all
                query strings: none - whitelist - all
            Ability to add CloudFront HTTP headers and Custom Headers to an origin request that were not included in the viewer request
            Create your own policy or use Predefined managed Policies

    Cache Policy vs Origin Request Policy
        Just think it simple,
            cache policy is from the client and cloudfront
            origin policy is more cloudfront and origin server (ec2 instance, s3, ...)
