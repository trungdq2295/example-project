CloudFront - Cache Behaviors
    Configure different setting for a given URL path pattern
    Example: one specific cache behavior to images/*.jpg files on your origin web server
    Route to different kind of origins/origin group based on the content type or pattern
        /images/*
        /api/*
        /* (default cache behavior)
    When adding additional Cache Behaviors, the default cache behavior is always the last to be processed and is always "/*"
