Security Groups:
    are the fundamental of network security in AWS
    control how traffic is allowed into or out of our EC2 instances
    only contains allow rules
    can reference by IP or security group
    Deeper Dive
        Security group acting as a "firewall" on EC2 instances
        They regulate:
            Access to Ports
            Authorised IP ranges - IPv4 and IPv6
            Control of inbound network (from other to the instance)
            Control of outbound network (from instance to other)
    Can be attached to multiple EC2 instance
    Locked down to a region/VPC combination
    Its good to maintain one separate security group for SSH access
    If your application is not accessible (time out), then its a security group issue
    If your application gives a "connection refused" error, then its an application error or its not launched
    All inbound traffic is blocked by default
    All outbound traffic is authorised by default
