What is Amazon EC2?
	One of the most popular AWS's offering
	Stand for Elastic Compute Cloud = Infrastucture as a service
	Consist many thing
		Renting virtual machines (Ec2)
		Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
		Distributing load across machines (ELB)
		Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group (ASG)
		
	Knowing EC2 is fundamental to understand how the Cloud works

EC2 will change IP for its instance once it get restarted

EC2 Sizing and configuration options	
	Operating System (OS)
	How mcuh compute power and core( CPU)
	How much random-access memory (RAM)
	
Ec2 instance types: example
	Following naming convention: m5.2xlarge
		m: instance class
		5: generation
		2xlarge: size within the instance class
	Compute Optimized
	    Great for compute-intesive tasks that reuire high performance processors
	        Batch processing workloads
	        Media transcoding
	        High Performance for web servers
	        High Performance computing
	        Scientific modeling & machine learning
	        Dedicated gaming servers
	Memory Optimized
	    Fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory
	    Use cases:
	        High performance, relational/non-relational databases
	        Distributed web scale cache stores
	        In-memory databases optimize for BI(business intelligence)
	        Applications performing real-time processing of big unstructured data
    Storage Optimized
        Great for storage-intensive tasks that require high, sequential read and write access to large data sets on local storage
        Use cases:
            High frequency online transaction processing (OLTP) systems
            Relational & NoSQL database
            Cache for in-memory databases (Redis)
            Data warehousing applications
            Distributed file systems
		
EC2 Instances Purchasing Options
	On-Demand Instance - short workload, predictable pricing, pay by second
		Pay for what you use
			Linux or Windows - billing per second, after the first minute
			All other OS - billing per hour
		Has the highest cost but no upfront payment
		No long-term commitment
		Recommended for short-term and un-interrupted workloads, where you cant predict how the application will behave
	Reserved Instance
	    Reserved Instances - long workloads
	    Convertible Reserved instances - long workloads with flexible instances
		Up to 72% discount compared to ON-demand
		You reserve a specific instance attributes
		    1 year(+discount)
		    3 years(+++discount)
		Payment Options -
		    No Upfront (+)
		    Partial Upfront (++)
		    All Upfront (+++)
        Reserved Instance's Scope - Regional or Zonal (reserve capacity in an AZ)
		Recommended for steady-state usage applications ( such as database)
		You can buy and sell in the Reserved Instance Marketplace if you don't need it anymore
		Convertible Reserved Instance
		    Can change the EC2 instance type, instance family, OS, scope and tenancy
		    Up to 66% discount
	Saving Plans
	    Commitment to an amount of usage, long workloads
		Discount based on long-term usage
		Commit to a certain type of usage ( $10/hour for 1 or 3 years)
		Usage beyond EC2 Savings Plans is billed at the On-Demand price
		Locked to a specific instance family & AWS region (M5 in us-east-1)
		Flexible across:
			Instance Size ( such as m5.xlarge, m5.2xlarge)
			OS ( Linux, Windows)
			Tenancy (Host, Dedicated, Default)
	Spot Instances
		Can get discount up to 90%
		Instances that you can "lose" at any point of time if your max price is less than the current spot price
		The MOST cost-efficient instances in AWS
		Useful for workloads that are resilient to failure
			Batch jobs
			Data analysis
			Image processing
			Any distributed workloads with a flexible start and end time
		Not suitable for critical jobs or databases
	Dedicated Hosts
		A physical server with EC2 instance capacity full dedicated to your use
		Allows you address compliance requirements and use your existing server bound software license( per-socket, per-core, per-VM software licenses)
		Purchasing Options
			On-Demand - pay per second for active Dedicated Host
			Reserved - 1 or 3 years (No Upfront, Partial Upfront, All Upfront)
        The most expensive option since you own a physical server
		Useful for software that have complicated licensing model (ByOL - Bring your Own License)
		Or for companies that have strong regulatory or compliance needs
	Dedicated Instances
		Instances run on hardware that's dedicated to you
		May share hardware with other instances in same account
		No control over instance placement (can move hardware after Stop/ Start)
	Capacity Reservations
		Reserve On-Demand instances capacity in a specific AZ for any duration
		You always have access to EC2 capacity when you need it
		No time commitment (create/cancel anytime), no billing discounts
		Combine with Regional Reserved Instances and Savings Plans to benefit from billing discounts
		You're charged at On-Demand rate whether you run instances or not
		Suitable for short-term, uninterrupted workloads that needs to be in a specific AZ
		
General purpose:
	Great for a diversity of workloads such as web servers or code repositories
	Balance between:
		Compute (CPU)
		Memory (such as RAM)
		Networking
    You can use EC2 connect to your ec2 instances
