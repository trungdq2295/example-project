EC2 Instance Metadata (IMDS)
    is powerful but one of the least known features to developers
    allows AWS EC2 instance to "learn about themselves" without using an IAM Role for that purpose
    The URL is http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data
    You can retrieve the IAM Role name from the metadata, but you can not retrieve IAM Policy
    Metadata = Info about the EC2 instance
    Userdata = launch script of the EC2 instnace

IMDSv2 vs IMDSv1
    IMDSv1 is accessing http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data
    IMDSv2 is more secure and is done in two steps:
        1/ Get session Token(limited validity) - using headers & PUT
        2/ Use Session Token in IMDSv2 call - using headers
