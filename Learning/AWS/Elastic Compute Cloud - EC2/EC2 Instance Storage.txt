EBS
	Elastic Book Store is a network drive you can attach to your instances while they run
	It allos your instances to persit data, even after their termination 
	They are bound to a specific AZ
	EBS is like "network USB"
	
EBS Volumne
	It's a network drive
		It uses the network to communicate the instance, which means there might be a  bit of latencyy
		It can be detached from an EC2 instance and attached to another one quickly.
	It's locked to an Availability Zone (AZ)
		An EBS Volume in us-east-1 can not be attached to us-east-1b
		You need to snapshot it if you want to move EBS Volume across AZ
	Have a provisioned capacity (size in GBS, and IOPS - the speed to write/read data)
		You get billed for all the provisioned capacity
		You can increase the capacity of the drive over time
	
	Control the EBS behaviour when an EC2 instance terminates
		By default, the root EBS volume is deleted( attribute enanbled)
		By default, any other attached EBS volume is not deleted ( attribute disabled)
	This can be controlled by the AWS console/ AWS CLI
	Use case: preserve root volume when instance is terminated

EBS Snapshot
	Make a backup(snapshot) of your EBS volume at a point in time
	Not necessary to detach volume to do snapshot, but recommended
	Can copy snapshots across AZ or Region
	Features:
		EBS Snapshot Archive
			Move a snapshot to an "Archive tier" that is 75% cheaper
			Takes within 24 to 72 hours for restoring the archive
		Recycle bin for EBS snapshots
			Set up rules to retain deleted snapshots so you can recover them after an accidental deletion
			Specify retention (from 1 day to 1 year)
		Fast Snapshot Restore ( FSR)
			Force full initialization of snapshot to have no latency on the first use ($$$)
			
EC2 Instance Sotre
	High-performance hardward disk ( bettern than EBS)
	EC2 Instant store lose their storage if they 're stopped (ephemeral)
	Good for buffer/ cache/ scratch data/ temporary content
	Risk of data loss if hardware fails
	Backup and Replication are your responsibility
	
EBS Volume types
	gp2/gp3 (SSD): General purpose SSD volume that balances price and performance for a wide variety of workloads
	io1/io2 (SSD): Highest-performance SSD volume for mission-critical low-latency or high-throughput workloads
	st1 (HDD): Low cost HDD volume designed for frequently accessed, thorughput intensive workloads
	sc1 (HDD): Lowest cost HDD volume deisgned for lesss frequently accessed workloads
	
	General purpose of SSD
		Cost effective storage, low-latency
		System boot volumes, Virtual Destops, Development and test environments
		1Gb - 6 TB
		gp3:
			Baseline of 3,000 IOPS and throughput of 125MB/sc1
			Can increase IOPS up to 16,000 and throughput up to 1,000 MB/s independently
		gp2:
			Small gp2 volumes can burst IOPS to 3,000
			Size of the volume and IOPS are linked, max IOPS is 16,000
			3 IOPS per GB, means at 5,334 GB we are at max IOPS
Why gp3 is better than gp2
