Lambda VPC
	By default, your lambda function is launched out side your own VPC (in an AWS-owned VPC)
	Therefore, it cannot access resources in your VPC( RDS, ElastiCach, internal ELB, ...)
	
Lambda in VPC
	You must define the VPC ID, the subnets and the security groups
	Lambda will create an ENI (Elastic Network Interface) in your subnets
	
Lambda with RDS Proxy
	If Lambda functions directly access your database, they may open too many connections under high load
	
	RDS Proxy
		Improve scalability by pooling and sharing DB connections
		Improve availability by reducing by the 66% failover time nad preserving connections
		Improve security by enforcing IAM authentication and storing credentials in Secrets Manager
	
	The Lambda function must be deployed in your VPC, because RDS Proxy is never publicly accessible
