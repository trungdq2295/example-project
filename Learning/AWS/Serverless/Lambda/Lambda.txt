Lambda
	Virtual Functions - no servers to manage ( AWS will help us to manage)
	Limited by time - short executions (15minutes)
	Run on-demand
	Scaling is automated

Benefit of Lambda
	Easy Pricing:
		Pay per request and compute time
		Free tier of 1,000,000 AWS Lambda request and 400,000 GBs of compute time
		
	Integrated with the whole AWS suite of services
	Integrated with many programming languages
	Easy monitoring through AWS CloudWatch
	Easy to get more resources per functions ( up to 10GB of RAM!)
	Increasing RAM will also improve CPU and network

Language Support
	Node.js (Javascript)
	Python
	Java (Java 8 compatible)
	C# (.NET Core)
	Golang
	c# / Powershell
	Ruby
	Custom Runtime API ( community supported, example RUST)
	
	Lambda Container Image
		The container image must implement the lambda runtime API
		ECS/ Fargate is preferred for running arbitrary Docker images

Lambda Pricing
	You can find overall pricing information here
		https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing
	Pay per calls:
		First 1,000,000 requests are free
		$0.20 per 1million requests thereafter ($0.0000002 per request)
		
	Pay per duration:
		400,000 GB-seconds of compute time per month if Free
		== 400,00 seconds if function is 1GB RAM
		== 3,200,000 seconds if function is 128MB RAM
		After that $1.00 for 600,000 GB-seconds
	
	It is usually very cheap to run AWS Lambda so it's very popular
