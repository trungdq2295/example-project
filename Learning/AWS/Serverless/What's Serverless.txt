What's Serverless?
	Serverless is a new paradigm in which the developers don't have to manage servers anymore....
	They just deploy code
	They jusy deploy functions
	Initially Serverless == Faas( Function as a Service)
	Serverless was pioneered by AWS Lambda but now also includes anything that's managed: "databases, messaging, storage, etc"
	Serverless does not mean there are no servers...
	It means you just don't manage/provision/ see them
