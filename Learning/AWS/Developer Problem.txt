Developer Prolems on AWS
    Managing Infrastructure
    Deploying code
    Configuring all DB, load balancers, etc,
    Scaling concerns 
    Most web apps have the same architecture ( ALB + ASG) 
    All the developers want is for their code to run 
    Possibly, consistently across different applications and environments

 

Elastic Beanstalk
    Elastic Beanstalk is a developer centric view of deploying an application on AWS 
    It uses all the component's we've seen before: EC2, ASG, ELB, RDS... 
    Managed service 
        Automatically handles capacity provisioning, load balancing, scaling, application health monitoring, instance configuration, ... 
        Just the application code is the responsibility of the developer 
    We still have full control over the configuration 
    Beanstalk is free but you pay for the underlying instances
Elastic Component
    Application: collection of Beanstalk component (environments, version,configurations, ...)
    Application Version: an iteration of your application code
    Environment:
        Collection of AWS resources running an application version (only one application version at a time)
        Tiers: Web Server Environment Tier & Worker Environment Tier  
        You can create multiple environments (dev,test,prod,...)
