Amazon MQ
	SQS, SNS are "cloud-native" services: proprietary protocols from AWS
	Traditional applications running from on-premises may use open protocols such as: MQTT, AMQP, STOMP, Openwire, WSS
	When migrating to the cloud, instead of re-engineering the application to use SQS and SNS, we can use Amazon MQ
	Amazon MQ is a managed message broker service for RabbitMQ, ActiveMq
	Amazon MQ doesn't "Scale" as much as SQS/SNS
	Amazon MQ runs on servers, can run in multi-az with failover
	Amazon MQ has both queue feature (~SQS) and topic features(~SNS)
