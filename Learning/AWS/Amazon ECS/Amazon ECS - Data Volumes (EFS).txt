Amazon ECS - Data Volumes (EFS)
    Share the data between multiple containers in the same Task Definition
	Mount EFS file systems onto ECS tasks
	Works for bot EC2 and Fargate launch types
	EC2 Tasks - using EC2 instance storage
	    Data are tied to the lifecycle of the EC2 instance
    Fargate Tasks - using ephemeral storage
        Data are tied to the container(s) using them
        20GiB - 200Gib
	Tasks running in any AZ will share the same data in the EFS file systems
	Fargate + EFS = Serverless
	Use cases: persistent multi-AZ shared storage for your containers
	
	Note:
		Amazon S3 cannot be mounted as a file system
