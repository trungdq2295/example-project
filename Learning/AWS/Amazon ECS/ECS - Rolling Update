ECS - Rolling Update
    When updating from v1 to v2, we can control how many tasks can be started and stopped, and in which order
    It's like K8S deployment but you can define the % maximum and % minimum,
        It will init based on the maximum,
        and until ecs task's ready, it will terminate the older version
        number of task's ready and number of old tasks which will be terminated, it based on the configuration min/max
