Amazon ECS - Load Balancer Integration
	Application Load Balancer supported and works for most use cases
	Network Load Balancer recommended only for high throughput/ high performance use cases, or to pair it with AWS Private Link
	Classic Load Balancer supported but not recommended(no advanced features- no Fargate)
	We get a Dynamic Host Port Mapping if you define only the container in the task definition
	For EC2 Launch Type
        The ALB finds the right port on your EC2 Instance thanks to the dynamic host port Mapping
            Note: This does not work with CLB
        you must allow on the EC2 instance's Security Group any port from the ALB's Security Group
    For Fargate Type
        Each task has a unique private IP
        Only define the container port(host port is not applicable)
        Example:
            ECS ENI Security Group
                Allow port 80 from the ALB
            ALB Security Group
                Allow port 80/443 from web
