Amazon ECS 
	EC2 - Launch Type
		ECS = Elastic Container Service
		Launch Docker containers on AWS = Launch ECS Tasks on ECS Clusters
		EC2 Lanuch Type: you must provision & maintain the infrastructure ( the EC2 instances)
		Each Ec2 Instance must run the ECS Agent to register in the ECS Cluster
	
	Fargate Launch Type
		Launch Docker containers on AWS
		You do not provision the infrastructure (no EC2 instances to manage)
		It's all Serverless
		You just create task definitions
		AWS just runs ECS Tasks for you based on the CPU/RAM you need
		To scale, just increase the number of tasks. Simple - no more EC2 instances
