AWS Cloud Development Kit
  CDK
  Define your cloud infrastructure using a familiar language : Js, Typescripts, python, Java and .NET
  Similar to CloudFormation but higher level
  Contains high level components called constructs
  The code is "compiled" into a CloudFormation template (JSON/YAML)
  You can therefore deploy infrastructure and application runtime code together
    Great for Lambda function
    Great for docker containers in ECS/EKS
  CDK vs SAM
    SAM:
      Serverless focused
      Write your template declaratively in JSON or YAML
      Great for quickly getting started with Lambda
      Leverages CloudFormation
    CDK:
      Support for all AWS Service
      Write infra in a programming languages
      Leverages CloudFormation
  You can combine both CDK + SAM
    you can use SAM CLI to locally test your CDK apps
    You must first run cdk synth
