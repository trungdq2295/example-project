AWS Cloud Development Kit - Unit Testing
  To test CDK apps, use CDK Assertions Module combined with popular test frameworks such as Jest (Javascript), or Pytest (Python)
  Verify we have specific resources, rules, conditions, parameters...
  Two type of tests:
    Fine-grained Assertions(common) - test specific aspects of the CloudFormation template (e.g, check if a resource has this property with this value)
    Snapshots Tests - test the synthesized Cloudformation template against a previously stored baseline template
  To import a template:
    Template.fromStack(MyStack): stack built in CDK
    Template.fromString(myString): stack build outside CDK
