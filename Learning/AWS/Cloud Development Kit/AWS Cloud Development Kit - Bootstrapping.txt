AWS Cloud Development Kit - Bootstrapping
  The process of provisioning resources for CDK before you can deploy CDK apps into AWS Environment
  AWS Environment = account + region
  When you use CDK to deploy, CloudFormation create a stack called CDK Toolkit and contains:
    S3 Bucket - to store files
    IAM Roles - to grant permissions to perform deployments
  You must run the following command for each new environment:
    cdk bootstrap aws://<aws_account>//<aws_region>
  Otherwise, you will get an error " Policy contains a statement with one or more invalid principal"
