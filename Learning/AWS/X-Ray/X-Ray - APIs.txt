    Write APIs
        PutTraceSegments: uploads segment documents to AWS X-Ray
        PutTelemetryRecords: Used by the X-Ray daemon to upload telemetry
            SegmentsReceivedCount, SegmentRejectedCounts, BackendConnectionErrors...
        GetSamplingRules: Retrieve all sampling rules (to know what/when to send)
        GetSamplingTarget & GetSamplingStatisticSummaries: advanced but similar to GetSamplingRules
        The X-Ray daemon needs to have an IAM policy authorizing the correct API calls to function correctly
