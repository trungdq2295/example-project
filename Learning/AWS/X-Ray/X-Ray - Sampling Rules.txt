X-Ray - Sampling Rules
    With sampling rules, you control the amount of data that you record
    The more data you send to X-Ray, the more you pay
    You can modify sampling rule without changing your code
    By default, the X-Ray SDK records the first request each second, and five percent of any addition request
    One RPS is the reservoir, which ensures that at least one trace is recorded each second as long the service is serving requests
    Five percent is the rate at which additional requests beyond the reservoir size are sampled

    Custom Sampling Rules
        You can create your own rules with the reservoir and rate
