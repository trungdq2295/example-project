X-Ray
    Visual analysis of our application
        For example: your service has 3 I/O call to other services and there's an issue
            So X-Ray helps you to visualize to figure our where issue comes from which services
    Troubleshooting performance (bottlenecks)
    Understand dependencies in a microservice architecture
    Pinpoint service issue ( like which service is the issue)
    Review request behavior
    Find errors and exceptions
    Are we meeting time SLA
    Where I am throttled
    identify users that are impacted

    X-RAy compatibility
        AWS Lambda
        Elastic Beanstalk
        ECS

        API Gateway
        EC2 instances or any application server (even on-premise)
    Leverage Tracing
        Tracing is an end to end way to following a "request"
        Each component dealing with the request adds its own "trace"
        Tracing is made of segments ( + sub segments)
        Annotations can be added to traces to provide extra-information
        Ability to trace:
            Every request
            Sample request ( as a % for example or a rate per minute)
        X-Ray security:
            IAM for authorization
            KMS for encryption at rest
    How to enable it?
        1/Your code must import AWS X-Ray SDK
            Very little code modification needed
            The application SDK will then capture:
                Calls to AWS service
                HTTP/HTTPS requests
                Database Calls (MySQL, PostgreSQL, DynamoDB)
                Queue calls (SQS)
        2/ Install the X-Ray daemon or enable X-Ray AWS Integration
            X-Ray daemon works as a low level UDP packet interceptor (Linux/Windows/Mac...)
            AWS Lambda /other AWS services already run the X-Ray daemon for you
            Each application must have the IAM rights to write data to X-RAY
    The X-Ray Magic
        X-Ray service collects data from all the different services
        Service map is computed from all the segments and traces
        X-Ray is graphical, so even non technical people can help troubleshoot
    Troubleshooting
        If X-Ray is not working on EC2
            Ensure the EC2 IAM Role has the proper permissions
            Ensure the EC2 instance is running the X-Ray Daemon
        To enable on AWS Lambda
            Ensure it has an IAM execution role with proper policy (AWSX-RayWriteOnlyAccess)
            Ensure that X-Ray is imported in the code
            Enable Lambda X-Ray Active Tracing
