X-Ray - Concepts
    Segments: each application/ service will send them
    Subsegments: If you need more details in your segment
    Trace: segments collected together to form an end-to-end trace
    Sampling: decrease the amount of requests sent to X-ray, reduce cost
    Annotations: Key Value pairs used to index traces and use with filters
    Metadata: Key Value pairs, not indexed, not used for searching
    The X-Ray daemon/ agent has a config to send traces cross account:
        make sure the IAM permissions are correct - the agent will assume the role
        This allows to have central account for all your application tracing
