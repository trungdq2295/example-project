S3 User-Defined object metadata & S3 Object Tags
    S3 User_defined Object Metadata
        When uploading an object, you can also assign metadata
        Name-value (key-value) pairs
        User-defined metadata names must begin with "x-amz-meta-"
        Amazon S3 stores user-defined metadata keys in lower case
        Metadata can be retrieved while retrieving the object
    S3 Object Tags
        Key-value paris for objects in Amazon S3
        Useful for fine-grained permissions (only access specific objects with specific tags)
        Useful for analytics purposes(using S3 Analytics to group by tags)

    You cannot search the object metadata or object tags
    Instead, you must use an external DB as a search index such as DynamoDB
