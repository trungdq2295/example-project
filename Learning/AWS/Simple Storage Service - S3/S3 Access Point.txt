S3 Access Point
	Example:
	    We could create a very complicated S3 bucket policy for users to access many data.
        The more users, the more data you have, the more unmanageable this may become.
        You can create an access point ( which contains policy for each S3 bucket). It will grant permission Read/Write for that user.
	
	Access Point simplify security management for S3 Buckets
	Each Access Point has 
		its owns DNS name ( Internet Origin or VPC Origin) 
		an access point policy ( similar to bucket policy) - manage security at scale
		
	VPC Origin
        We can define the access point to be the accessible only from within the VPC
        You must create a VPC Endpoint to access the Access Point (Gateway or Interface Endpoint)
        The VPC Endpoint Policy must allow access to the target bucket and Access Point
