Amazon S3
	Amazon S3 is one of the main buidling blocks of AWS 
	It's advertised as "infinitely scaling" storage 
	Many websute use Amazone S3 as backbone 
	Many AWS services use Amazon S3 as an integration as well
	
Use cases:
	Backup and Storage 
	Disaster Recovery 
	Archive 
	Hybrid Cloud Storage 
	Application Hosting 
	Data lakes & big data analytics 
	Software delivery 
	Statics website

Bucket
	Amazon S3 allows people to storage objects (files) in "buckets" (directories) 
	Buckets must have a globally unique name (across all regions all accounts) 
	Buckets are defined at the region level 
	S3 looks like a global service but buckets are created in a region 
	Naming Convention
		No uppercase,
		No underscore, 
		3-63 characters long, 
		Not an IP, 
		Must start with lowercase letter or number, 
		Must not start with the prefix xn-- 
		Must not end with the suffix-s3alias
		
Objects
	Objects (files) have a key 
	The key is a the full patch 
		Example :
			s3://my-bucket/my_file.txt  ( Key is my_file.txt)
			s3://my-bucket/another_folder/my_file.txt  ( Key is another_folder/my_file.txt)
	The key is composed of prefix + object name 
		Example: 
			s3://my-bucket/my_folder/another_filder/my_file.txt 
				Prefix: my_folder/another_filder/
				Object name: my_file.txt
	There's no concept of "directories" within buckets (although the UI will trick you to think otherwise)
	Just keys with very long names that contains slashes ("/")
	
	Object values are the content of the body: 
		Max Object Size is 5TB(5000GB) 
		If uploading more than 5GB, must use "multi-part upload" mean split into small pieces 
		Metadata (list of text key/ value paris - system or user metadata) 
		Tag (Unicode key/ value par - up to 10) - useful for security /lifecycle 
		Version ID (if versioning is enabled)
Security
	User-Based 
		IAM Policies - which API calls should be allowed for a specific user from IAM 
	Resource-Based 
		Bucket Policies - bucket wide rules from the S3 console - allows cross account 
		Object Access control List (ACL) - finer grain ( can be disaled) 
		Bucket Access Control List (ACL) - less common ( can be disabled) 
	Note: 
		an IAM principal can access an S3 object if 
			THe user IAM permissions ALLOW it OR the resource policy ALLOWS it 
			And there's no explicit deny 
	Encryption: encrypt objects in Amazon S3 using encryption keys
