S3 Object Lambda
	Use AWS Lambda Functions to change the object before it is retrieved by the caller application 
	Only one S3 bucket is needed, on top of which we create S3 Access Point and S3 Object Lambda Access Points 
	Use Cases: 
		Redacting personally identifiable information for analytics or non production envionments. 
		Converting across data formats, such as converting XML to JSON 
		Resizing and watermarking images on the fly using caller-specific details, such as the user who requested the object
