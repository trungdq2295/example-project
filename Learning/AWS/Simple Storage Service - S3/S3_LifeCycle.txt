S3 Lifecycle
    Life Cycles:
        Standard
        Standard IA
        Intelligent Tiering
        One-zone IA
        Glacier Instant Retrieval
        Glacier Flexible Retrieval
        Glacier Deep Retrieval
    You can transition object between storage class
    For infrequently accessed object, move them to standard IA
    For archive objects that you don't need fast access, move them to Glacier or Glacier Deep Archive
    Moving objects can be automated using Lifecycle Rules
    Lifecycle Rules
        Transition Actions - configure objects to transition to another storage class
            Move objects to Standard IA class 60 days after creation
            Move to glacier for archiving after 6 months
        Expiration actions - configure objects to expire (delete) after some time
            Access log files can be set to delete after a 365 days
            Can be used to delete old version of files (if versioning is enabled)
            Can be used to delete incomplete Multi-Part uploads
        Rules can be created for
            a certain prefix
            certain objects Tags
    S3 Analytics
        Help you decide when to transition objects to the right storage class
        Recommendation for Standard and Standard IA
            Does not work for One-Zone IA or Glacier
