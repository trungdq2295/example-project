S3 - Default Encryption vs Bucket Policies
    SSE-S3 encryption is automatically applied to new objects stored in S3 bucket
    Optionally, you can "force encryption" using a bucket policy and refuse any API call to PUT an S3 object without encryption headers (SSE-KMS or SSE-C)
    Bucket Policies are evaluated before "Default Encryption"
