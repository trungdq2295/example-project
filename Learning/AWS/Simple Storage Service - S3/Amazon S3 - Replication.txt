Amazon S3 - Replication(CRR & SRR)
	Must enable Versioning in source and destination buckets
	Cross-Region replication (CRR)
	Same-Region replication(SRR)
	Buckets can be in different AWS accounts
	Copying is asynchronous
	Must give proper IAM permisisons to S3
	Use cases:
		CRR - cimpliance, lower latency access, replication acrosss acounts
		SRR - log aggregation, live replication between production and test account
		
	After you enable Replication, onl new objects are replicated
	Optionally, you can replicate existing object using S3 Batch Replication
		Replicates existing objects and objects that failed replication
	
	For DELETE operations
		Can replicate delete markers from source to target( optional setting)
		Deletions with a version ID are not replicated(to avoud malicious delete)
		
	There is "no chaining" of replication
		If bucket 1 has replication into bucket 2, which has replication into bucket 3
		THen objects are created in bucket 1 are not replicated to bucket 3
