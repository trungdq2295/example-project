Amazon S3 - Access Log
	For audit purpose, you may want to log all access to S3 buckets 
	Any request made to S3, from any account, authorized or denied, will be logged into another S3 bucket 
	That data can be analyzed using data analysis tools... 
	The target logging bucket must be in the same AWS region
	Warning: 
	Do not set your logging bucket to be the monitored bucket 
	It will create a logging loop, and your bucket will grow exponentially
