	Elastic √çP
		When  you stop and then start EC2 instanc, it can change its public IP
		If you need to have a fixed public IP for your instance, you need an Elastic IP
		An Elastic IP is a public Ipv4 IP you own as long as you don't delete it
		You can attach it to one instance at a time
		
		With an Elastic IP address, you can mask the failure of an intance or software by rapidly remapping the address to another instance in your account
		You can only have 5 Elastic IP in your account ( can ask AWS for more)
		
		Try to avoid using Elastic IP
			Reflect poor architectural decisions
			Instead, use a random public IP and register DNS name to it

Placement Groups
	Cluster
		All EC2 instances are on same hardware
		Pros: 
			Great Network - low latency between instance ( 10 gigabits bandwidth between instances)
		Cons: if the rack fails, all the instances fails at the same time
		Use cases:
			Big Data job that need to complete fast
			Applicaton that needs extremely low latency and high network throughput
	Spread
		All EC2 instances are located on different hardware
		Pros: 
			can span across Availability Zones (AZ)
			Reduced risk is simultaneous failure
		Cons:
			Limited to the size of placement groups ( maxium size is 7 instances per group)
		Use cases:
			Application that need to maximize high availibity
			Critical Applications where each instance must be isolated from failure from each other
	Partition
		Multiple partition in a hardware(Up to 7 parition) and in each partition will have multiple EC2 instances ( Up to 100 EC2 Instance)
		Pros:
			The instances in a parition do not share racks with the instances in the other parition
			A partition failure can affect EC2 instance inside it but not other partition
			EC2 instances get access to the parition information as metadata
		Use Cases:
			Big data application such ass Casssandra, kafka


Elastic Network Interfaces (ENI)
	Logical Component in a VPC that represents a virtual network card
	The ENI can have the following attribute
		Primary private Ipv4, one or more secondary IPv4
		One Elastic Ip (IPv4) per private Ipv4
		One Public Ipv4
		One or more security groups
		A MAC address
	You can create ENI independently and attach them on the fly (move the) on instnaces for failover ( It mean you 1 ENI belong to EC2 instances and you can move them to another EC2 instances)
	Bound to specific AZ
				
				
EC2 Hibernate
	The in-memory (RAM) state is preserved
	The instance boot is much faster ( the OS is not stopped /restarted)
	Under the hood: the RAM state is written to a file in the root EBS volumen
	The root EBS volume must be encrypted
	Workflow
		When we hibnernate a EC2 instance, RAM will be copied into Root EBS Volume and deleted in EC2. And when we start again, RAM will be copied from EBS volumn to EC2 instances, that's why data on RAM will be saved
	Use case:
		Long-running process
		Saving the RAM state
		Services that take time to initialize
	Good to know:
		Supproted instance family - c3, c4, c5, i3
		Instace RAM Size - must be less than 150GB
		Instace Size - not supported for bare metal instances
		AMI - Amazon Linux 2, Linux AMI, Ubuntu,
		Root Volume - must be EBS, encrypted, not instance store, and large
		Available for On-Demand, Reserved and Spot Instance
		An instance can not be hibernated for more than 60 days( number of days can be changed)
