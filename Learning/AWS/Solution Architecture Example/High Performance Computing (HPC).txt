High Performance Computing (HPC)
	The cloud is the perfect place to perform HPC 
	You can create a very high number of resources in no time
	You can speed up time to results by adding more resources
	You can pay only for hte system you have used
	
	Perform genomics, computational chemistry, financial risk modeling, weather prediction, machine learning, deep learning, autonomous driving
	
	Which services help to perform HPC
	
Data Management Transfer
	AWS Direct Connect:
		Move GB/s of data to the cloud, over a private secure network
	Snowball & Snowmobile
		Move PB of data to the cloud
	AWS DataSync
		Move large amount of data between on-premise and S3, EFS, FSx for Windows

Compute and Networking
	Ec2 Instances:
		CPU optimized, GPU optimized
		Spot Instances/ Spot Fleets for cost savings + Auto Scaling
	EC2 Placement Groups: Cluster for good nertwork performance
	EC2 Enhanced Networking (SR-IOV)
		Higher bandwidth, higher PPs (packet per second), low latency
		Option 1: Elastic Network Adapter ( ENA) up to 100Gbs
		Option 2: Intel 82599 VF up to 10Gbps - Legacy ( Old ENA)
	Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA)
		Improved ENA for HPC, only works for Linux
		Freate for inter-node communications, tightly couple workloads
		Leverages Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard
		Bypasses the underlying Linux OS to provide low-latency, reliable transport

Storage
	Instacned-attached storage:
		EBS: scale up to 256,000 IOPS with io2 Block Express
		Instance Store: scale to millions of IOPS, linked to EC2 instance, low latency
	Network storage:
		Amazon S3: large blob, not a file system
		EFS: scale IOPS ased on total size, or use provisioned IOPS
		FSx for Lustre:
			HPC optimized dsitributed file system, millions of IOPS
			Backed by S3

Automation and Orchestration
	AWS Batch
		supports multi-node parallel jobs, which enables you to run single jobs that span multiple EC2 instances
		Easily schedule jobs and luanch EC2 instances accordingly
	AWS Parallel Cluster
		Open-source cluster management tool to deploy HPC on AWS
		Configure with text files
		Automate creation of VPC, Subnet, cluster type and instances types
		Ability to enable EFA on the cluster (improves network performance)
