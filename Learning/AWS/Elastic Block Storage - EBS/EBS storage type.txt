EBS Volume types
	gp2/gp3 (SSD): General purpose SSD volume that balances price and performance for a wide variety of workloads
	io1/io2 (SSD): Highest-performance SSD volume for mission-critical low-latency or high-throughput workloads
	st1 (HDD): Low cost HDD volume designed for frequently accessed, thorughput intensive workloads
	sc1 (HDD): Lowest cost HDD volume deisgned for lesss frequently accessed workloads
	
	General purpose of SSD
		Cost effective storage, low-latency
		System boot volumes, Virtual Destops, Development and test environments
		1Gb - 6 TB
		gp3:
			Baseline of 3,000 IOPS and throughput of 125MB/sc1
			Can increase IOPS up to 16,000 and throughput up to 1,000 MB/s independently
		gp2:
			Small gp2 volumes can burst IOPS to 3,000
			Size of the volume and IOPS are linked, max IOPS is 16,000
			3 IOPS per GB, means at 5,334 GB we are at max IOPS
Why gp3 is better than gp2
	gp3 is successor of gp2
	if you want to increase IOPS, you need to increase the volume size in gp2
	gp3 removed this limitation and you can increase the IOPs and/or throughput independently up to 16,000 IOPs and 1,000 MiB/s respectively.
	gp3 is cheaper than gp2
	
	Provisioned IOPS (PIOPS) SSD
		Critical business applications with sustained IOPS performance
		Or applications that need more than 16,000 IOPS
		Great for database workloads( sensitive performance and consistency)
		io1/io2 (4GB - 16TB):
			Max IOPS: 64,000 for Nitro EC2 instances & 32,000 for other
			Can increase PIOPS independently from storage size
			io2 have more durability and more IOPS per GB(at the same price as io1)
		io2 Block Express (4GB - 64TB):
			Sub-milisecond latency
			Max PIOPS: 256,000 with an IOPS:GB ratio of 1,000:1
		Support EBS Multi-atach

EBS Multi-attach
	Only support in io1/io2
	Attach the same EBS volume to multiple EC2 instances in the same AZ
	Each instance has full read and write permissions
	Only in the same AZ
	Can be attached up to 16 Ec2 instances
