EFS - Elastic File System
    Managed NFS (network file system) that can be mounted on many EC2
    Scales automatically, pay-per-use, no capacity planning
    EFS works with EC2 instance in multi-AZ
    Highly available, scalable, expensive (3x gp2), pay per use
    Use cases:
        content management
        Web serving
        data sharing
        Wordpress
    Use NFSv4.1 protocol
    Use security group to control access to EFS
    Encryption at rest using KMS

    Performance & Storage Classes
        EFS Scale
            1000s of concurrent NFS clients, 10GB+ /throughput
            Grow to Petabyte-scale network file system, automatically
        Performance Mode ( set at FS creation time)
            General purpose (default) - latency-sensitive use cases( web servers, CMS, etc ..)
            Max I/O - higher latency, throughput, highly parallel ( big data, media processing)
        Throughput Mode
            Bursting - 1 TB = 50MiB/s + burst of up to 100MiB/s
            Provisioned - set your throughput regardless of storage size, ex: 1GiB/s for 1TB storage
            Elastic - automatically scales throughput up or down based on your workloads
                Up to 3GiB/s for reads and 1GiB/s for writes
                Used for unpredictable workloads
        Storages Classes
            Storage Tier (lifecycle management feature - move file after N days)
                Standard: for frequently accessed files
                Infrequent access (EFS-IA): cost to retrieve file, lower price to store
                Archive: rarely accessed data (few times each year), 50% cheaper
                Implement lifecycle policies to move files between storage tiers
            Availability and durability
                Standard: Multi-AZ, great for prod
                One Zone: One AZ, great for dev, backup enabled by default, compatible with IA (EFS One Zone-IA)
            Over 90% in cost savings
