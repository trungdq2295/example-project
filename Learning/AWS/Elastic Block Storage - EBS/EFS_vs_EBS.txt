EBS Volume - Elastic Block Storage
	one instance (except multi-attach io1/io2)
	are locked at the AZ
	gp2: IO increase if the disk size increase
	io1: can increase IO independently
	To migrate an EBS volume across AZ
		Take a snapshot
		Restore snapshot into another AZ
		EBS backups use IO and you shouldn't run them while your application is handling a lot of traffic cuz it will impact performance
	Root EBS Volumes of instances can be terminated by default if the Ec2 instance gets terminated ( can disable it)
EFS
    Mounting up to 100s instances across AZ
    EFS share website files(Wordpress)
    Only for Linux instances
    EFS has a higher price point than EBS (the more space u use in EFS, the higher price is while EBS is fixed size)
    Can leverage EFS-IA for cost savings ( move an unused file to IA EFS)
