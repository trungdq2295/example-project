EC2 Instance Store
    EBS volumes are network drives with good but "limited" performance
    If you need a high-performance hardware disk, use EC2 Instance Store
    Better I/O performance
    EC2 instance Store lose their storage if they're stopped
        => Not good for long-term storage
        Good for buffer / cache / scratch data / temporary content
    Risk of data loss if hardware fails
    Backups and Replication are your responsibility
