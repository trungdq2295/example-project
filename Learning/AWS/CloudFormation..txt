CloudFormation
	is a declarative way of outlining your AWs Infrastucture, for any resource (most of them are supported)
	For example, within a Cloudformation template, you say:
		I want a security group
		I want two EC2 instances using this security group
		I want an S3  bucket
		I want a load balancer (ELB) in front of these machines
	CloudFormation creates those for you, in the right order, with the exact configuration that you specify

Benefits of AWS CloudFormation
	Infrastructure as code
		No resources are manually created, which is excellent for control
		Changes to the infrastructure are reviewed through code
	
	Cost 
		Each resource within the stack is tagged with an identified so yo ucan easily see how much a stack cost you
		You can estiamte the costs of your resources using the CloudFormation template
		Saving strategy: In dev, you could automation deletion of templates at 5PM and recreated at 8AM safely
	
	Productivity 
		Ability to destroy and re-create an infrastructure on the cloud on the fly
		Automated generation of Diagra mfor your templates
		Declarative programming ( no need to figure out ordering and orchestration)
	
	Don't re-invent the wheel
		LEverage existing templates on the web
		Leverage the documentation
	
	Supports (almost) all AWS resources
		Everything we'll se in this course is supported
		you can use "custom resources" for resources that are not supported
