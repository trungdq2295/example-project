Beanstalk CLI
    We can install an additional CLI called "EB cli" which makes working with Beanstalk from the CLI easier
    Basic commands are:
        eb create
        eb status
        eb health
        eb events
        eb logs
        eb open
        eb deploy
        eb config
        eb terminate
    It's helpful for you automated deployment pipelines

    Deployment Processes
        Describe Dependencies
            (requirement.txt for Python, packages.json for Node.js)
        Package code as zip, and describe dependencies
        Console: upload zip file ( creates new app version), and then deploy
        CLI: create new app version using (uploads zip), and then deploy
        Beanstalks will deploy the zip on each EC2 instance, resolve dependencies and start the application
