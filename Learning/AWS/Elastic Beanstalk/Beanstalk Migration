Beanstalk Migration
    Load Balancer:
        After creating an Elastic Beanstalk environment, you cannot change the ELB type (only the configuration)
        To migrate:
            1. create a new environment with the same configuration except LB (can't clone)
            2. deploy your application onto the new environment
            3. perform a CNAME swap or Route 53 update
    RDS
        can be provisioned with Beanstalk, which is great for dev / test
        This is not great for prod as the database lifecycle is tied to the Beanstalk environment lifecycle
        The best for prod is to separately create an RDS database and provide our EB application with the connection string
    Decouple RDS
        Create a snapshot of RDS DB(as a safeguard)
        Go to the RDS console and protect the RDS database from deletion
        Create a new Elastic Beanstalk environment, without RDS, point your application to existing RDS
        perform a CNAME swap (blue/green) or Route 53, confirm working
        Terminate the old environment (RDS won't be deleted)
        Delete CloudFormation Stack (in DELETE_FAILED state)
