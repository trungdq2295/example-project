Amazon SQS - Long Polling
	When a consumer requests messages from the queue, it can optionally "wait" for messages to arrive if there are none in the queue
	This is called Long Polling
	Long Polling decrease the number of API calls made to SQS while increasing the efficiency and latency of your application
	The wait time can be between 1 sec to 20sec ( 20sec is preferable)
	Long Polling is preferable to Short Polling
	Long polling can be enabled at the queue level or at the API level using WaitTimeSeconds PAI
