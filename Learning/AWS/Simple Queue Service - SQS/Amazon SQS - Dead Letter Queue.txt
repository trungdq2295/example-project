Amazon SQS - Dead Letter Queue
	If a consumer fails to process a message within the Visibility Timeout... the message go back to the queue
	We can set a threshold of how many times a message can go back to the queue
	After the MaximumReceives threshold is exceeded, the message goes into a dead letter queue
	Useful for debugging
	DLQ of a FIFO queue must also be a FIFO queue
	DLQ of a standard queue must also be a standard queue
	Make sure to process the messages in the DLQ before they expire
	    Good to set a retention of 14 days in the DLQ

    Re-drive to Source
        feature to help consume messages in the DLQ to understand what is wrong with them
        When our code is fixed, we can re-drive the messages from DLQ back to queue (or any other queue) in batches without writing custom code
