Amazon SQS - FIFO Queue
	FIFO = First In first Out ( ordering of messages in the queue)
	Limited throughput: 300 msg/s without batching, 3000msg/s with
	Exactly-once send capability ( by removing duplicates)
	Messages are processed in order by the consumer
	Ordering by Message Group ID ( all messages in the same group are ordered) - mandatory parameter

	Deduplication
	    De-duplication interval is 5minute
	    Two de-duplication methods:
	        Content-based deduplication: will do a SHA-256 hash of the message body
	        Explicitly provide a Message Deduplication ID
    Message Grouping
        IF you specify the same value of MessageGroupId in an SQS FIFO queue, you can only have one consumer and all messages are in order
        To get ordering at the level of a subset of messages, specify different values for MessageGroupId
            Messages that share a common Message Group ID will be in order within the group
            Each group Id can have a different consumer (parallel processing)
            Ordering across groups is not guaranteed
