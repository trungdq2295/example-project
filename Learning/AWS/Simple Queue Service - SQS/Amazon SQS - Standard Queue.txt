Amazon SQS - Standard Queue
	Oldest offering (over 10 years old) 
	Fully managed service, used to decouple applications 
	Attributes:

SQS - Producing Messages 
	Produced to SQS using the SDK (SendMessage API)

SQS - Consuming Messages
	Consumers (running on EC2 instances, servers, or AWS Lambda)...

		Useful for cross-account access to SQS queus
