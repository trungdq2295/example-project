Amazon SQS - Extended Client
	Message size limit 256 Kb, how to send large message e.g 1GB?
	Using the SQS Extended Client (Java Library)
	The idea is you gonna upload your large message into the S3 buckets and send metadata to SQS
	    Consumer will poll metadata message from SQS and then retrieve the large message from S3 using the info from metadata
