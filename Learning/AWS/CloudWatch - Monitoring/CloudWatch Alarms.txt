CloudWatch Alarms
	Alarams are used to trigger notifications for any metric
	Various options ( sampling, %, max,min,etc...)
	Alarm states:
		OK
		INSUFFICIENT_DATA
		ALARM
	Period
		length of time in seconds to evaluate the metric
		High resolution custom mertrics: 10sec, 30sec or multiples of 60sec
		
Targets
	Stop, Terminate, Reboot, or Recover an EC2 instace
	Trigger Auto Scaling Action
	Send notification to SNS ( from which you can do pretty much anything)

Composite Alarms
	CloudWatch Alarms are on a single metric
	Composite Alarms are monitoring the states of multiple other alarms
	AND and OR conditions
	helpful to reduce "alarm noise" by creating complex composite alamrs
	
EC2 Instance Recovery
	Status Check:
		Instance status = check the EC2 VM
		System status = check the underlying hardware
		
		Recovery: EC2 will have same private, public, elastic IP, metadata, placement group
		
Good to know
	Alarms can be created based on CloudWatch Logs Metrics Filter
	To test alarms and notifications, set the alarm state to alarm using CLI 
	"aws cloudwatch set-alarm-state --alarm-name "myalarm" --state-value ALARM --state-reason "testing purpose"
