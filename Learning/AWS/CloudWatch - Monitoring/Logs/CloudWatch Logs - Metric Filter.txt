CloudWatch Logs - Metric Filter
    Can use filter expression
        For example, find a specific IP inside of a log
        Or count occurrences of "ERROR" in your logs
        Metric filters can be used to trigger alarms
    Filters do not retroactively filter data. Filters only publish the metric data points for events that happen after the filter was created
    Ability to specify up to 3 Dimensions for the metric filter
