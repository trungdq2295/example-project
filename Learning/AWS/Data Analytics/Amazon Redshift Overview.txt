Amazon Redshift Overview
	Redshift is based on PstgreSQL, but it's not used for OLTP
	It's OLAP - online analytical processing (analytics and data warehousing)
	10x better performance than other data warehouess, scale to PBs of Data
	Columnar storage of data (instead of row based) & parallel query engine
	Pay as you go based on the instances provisioned
	Has a SQL interface for performing the queries
	Bussiness Intelligence tools such as Amazon Quicksight or Tableau integrate with it
	vs Athena: faster queries/joins/aggregations thanks to the indexes

Redshift Cluster 
	Leader node: for query planning, results aggregations
	Compute node: for performing the queries, send results to leaders
	You provision the node size in advance
	You can used Reserved Instances for cost savings

Refshift - Snapshots & DR
	Redshift has "Multi-AZ" mode for some clusters
	Snapshots are point-in-time backups of a cluster, stored internally in S3
	Snapshots are incremental (only what has changed is saved)
	You can restore a snapshot into a new cluster
	Automated: every 8 hours, every 5GB, or on a schedule. SEt retention
	Manual: snapshot is retained until you delete it
	You can configure Amazon Redshift to automatically copy snapshots (automated or manual) of a cluster o another AWS regions
	
Large Inserts are much betters

Redshift Spectrum
	Query data that is already in S3 without loading it
	Miust have a Redshift cluster available to start the query
	THe query is then submitted to thousands of Redshift Spectrum nodes
