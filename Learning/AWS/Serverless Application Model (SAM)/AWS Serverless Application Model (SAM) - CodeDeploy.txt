AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) - CodeDeploy
    SAM framework natively uses CodeDeploy to update Lambda functions
    Traffic Shifting feature
    Pre and Post traffic hooks features to validate deployment (before the traffic shift starts and after it ends)
    Easy & Automated rollback using CloudWatch alarms
    Example: The idea is SAM trigger CICD CodeDeploy to deploy Lambda alias v2 and there's already v1 is running
        CodeDeploy will be running some Lambda pre-traffic to test the alias v2
        And then it will do traffic shifting with alias v1 and v2 according to deployment strategies
        And then it will monitor through CloudWatch Alarm
        And then deployment is done, We can run some Lambda post-traffic hook to run some test(optional)
        and if everything goes well, v1 will goes away

    CodeDeploy
        AutoPublishAlias
            Detects when new code is being deployed
            Creates and publishes an updated version of that function with the latest code
            Points the alias to the updated version of the Lambda function
        DeploymentPreference
            Canary, Linear, AllAtOnce
        Alarms
            Alarms that can trigger a rollback
        Hooks
            Pre and post traffic shifting Lambda function to test your deployment
