What is GraphQL
	GraphQL is a query language to retrieve data from Server and it will response what we need to get from client

For example : if client require id and fullname, graphql will response id and fullname only.

How we use it

When to use GraphQL rather than Rest
	Data fetching control
		Will return what we need, while rest need to create a model for it
	Multiple Datasource
		GraphQL simplifies the task of aggregating data from multiple sources or APIs and then resolving the data to the client in a single API call. On the other hand, API technologies like REST would require multiple HTTP calls to access data from multiple sources.
	Single Endpoint
		For Rest it can be GET/PUT/POST/DELETE method and many endpoints such as product/{id}, products, ...
		For GraphQL, single endpoints /graphql only
		
	

Drawback of GraphQL
	Complexity Config
	Need to design carefully to response data client need
	Difficult to handle Error (Exception in Java)
	File Uploading is not part in GraphQL so implementation is up to us like
		+ Encode to base64 but request will be larger and more expensive to encode and decode
		+ A separate server or API
		+ A library like graphql-upload, which implements the GraphQL multipart request specification
