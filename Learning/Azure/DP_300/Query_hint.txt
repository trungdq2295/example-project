Query Hint
    You define the hint for the query
        Example: using option merge join
    Since SQL server automatically choose the best plan for query so This is the last option to optimize performance when you're sure your plan is better than SQL server automatically plan
    Option:
        KKEEP PLAN
            "Don’t recompile too aggressively — wait until regular stats thresholds are met."
        KEEPFIXED PLAN
            Means you keep the plan fixed, don't change it even when there're re-compile option which change the plan after each query
            "Never recompile this plan unless absolutely necessary (e.g., schema change, option hint change)."
        OPTIMIZE FOR UNKNOWN
            You generate a plan based on the average data distribution ignoring the condition in where clause
            Which mean: you have a Where in query, this plan still doesnt care about it. It only care about data distribution in storage
        ROBUST PLAN
            “SQL Server — don’t take risky shortcuts, build a safer plan.”
            You build a safe plan without affecting resource server such as memory or cpu usage

    Store Procedure
        Optimize for Unknown
            Is good if you want to optimize for a particular parameter with unknown values
