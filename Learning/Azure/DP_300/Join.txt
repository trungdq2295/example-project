Join in execution plan
    Three type of join in execution plan
        Nested loop join
            Joins each outer row with each matching inner row (can be full scan or seek) so it uses the least I/O
            "Cross Join" usually use nested loop join in execution plan
        Merge Join
            It's very fast because it know when it can and merge and when it can't
            Inner join, left join, right join on index column
        Hash Join - Hash Match
            Least Favourite Join
            Used for large unsorted,  non indexed-inputs
            Can be used in middle of complex query as intermediate results are often not indexed
