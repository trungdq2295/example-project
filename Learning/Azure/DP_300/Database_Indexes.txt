Database Index
    Cluster Index
        Means the table would get reshaped for that particular index. All the rows would be re-resorted in that order
        1 table only have 1 cluster index
        It stores all the row data on that index, so it can be retrieved faster
        When you use execution plan: it's a scan
    Non-cluster index
        It just maintains separately
        It stores the pointer to the row of that index so everytime you retrieved data, it will go to that pointer => that row data
        When you use execution plan: it's a seek
