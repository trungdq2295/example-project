SQL Data Sync
    Allows you to synchronize Data across multiple data
    YOu need to have primary key and can't change that key

    You need to define 1 Azure DB as a hub database
    It's bi-directional change in database
    For example:

        If a member database change, it send to the hub and the hub send to other member database
    You also need a sync database which is the same region as Hub Database
    The conflict resolution:
        What happen if a hub database change a record and a member database also change that record
        AzureSQL allow you to config this conflcit resolution to let either 1 of them win
