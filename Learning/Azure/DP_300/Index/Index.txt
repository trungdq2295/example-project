Index
    Note: SARgable mean Search Argument-able which refer to whether a query can efficiently use an index
    Why
        Index stop us from scanning all table and allow us to seek a particular point
    Requirement to create an index
        You have so many data like hundreds or thousands more data
        Small column size
            Integer column is the best suitable
            varchar column can consume more disk space so you need to be aware of size of varchar
        Column in where clause
            The condition should be SARgable
            => the function such as YEAR(), LEN() won't be working with index
    Cluster index
        Once per table
        Usually created with primary key => need to be unique
        Should be use it for frequently query and range query
        It re-sorts the table
    Non-cluster index
        You can have many non-cluster index
        Cons:
            The operation create, update, delete will make index adjust the data so if you have many index, it can slowdown these operations
    Filtered-Index
        Apply index of filtered condition
        Cons
            Smaller size index
            Faster queries
            Less maintenance overhead
        Pros:
            If it's outside the filter condition, it won't be applied
    FillFactor
        Control how full each index page is built
        Used to reserve the space for future insertion
        Example: each page can be stored 10 data. Instead of storing all 10 data, you store 6 only and move 4 other data to another page
            So if you insert new data next time, instead of creating new page, it will store to exist page
            When the page full, azure sql server does the split page again and each page stores up to 60 data
        => very useful when your table has frequent update
