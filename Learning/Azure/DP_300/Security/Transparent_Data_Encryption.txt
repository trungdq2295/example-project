Transparent Data Encryption(TDE)
    Encrypt you data at-rest in azuresql
    Decrypt when you read data
    We can't apply TDE on Azure managed instance through the Azure UI website
    We can use T-SQL to apply on both AzureSQL and Azure Managed Instance
        Example: Alter Database [DatabaseName] SET ENCRYPTION ON
