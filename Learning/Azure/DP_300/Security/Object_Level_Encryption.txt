Object Level Encryption
    It's to encrypt your data on specific column
    It works on column rather than select an row. Which mean all the column in reach row will be encryptted
    There's 2 type encrypted
        Deterministic:
            Same value: same cipher text
            Good to use if your column will be used to join
        Randomize
            Same value: different cipher text
            Good to use if your column won't be use to join
            Can't be use in join, group by, indices and distinct
    How do we let someone read a column?
        Give the reader’s principal (app/user/managed identity) Key Vault permissions (Get/UnwrapKey/WrapKey etc.)
        and ensure they use an Always Encrypted–aware client (driver) or have enclave setup.
        The DB itself only holds encrypted CEK metadata.
