DMV
    Dynamic Management views
    Used to gather query performance information
    are prefixed with sys.dm_[functional area]
    We have
        sys.dm_exec_query_stats
            Find top N queries ranked by average CPU time, the most cumulative CPU queries
        sys.dm_exec_procedure_Stats
            Same for query stats but used for procedures
        sys.dm_exec_requests
            Find still running session (by the time you execute this view)
            Concurrent requests right now (status ='Runnable')
            In Azure SQL Database, relates only to current database and background tasks, not other databases
        sys.dm_exec_connections
            Current active sessions right now
        sys.dm_db_resource_Stats (Azure SQL Database),
        sys.resource_stats ( all databases - must be in "master" database in AzureSQL Database)
        sys.server_resource_stats( Managed Instance)
        sys.elastic_pool_resource_stats (elastic pool databases)
            These views are used to identity data and log I/O usage
        sys.dm_tran_active_transaction
            Find long running transactions
        sys.dm_exec_cached_plan
        sys.dm_exec_sql_text
        sys.dm_exec_query_plan_Stats
            Theres used to retrieved cached plan
        sys.dm_db_missing_index_details
            To explain what index is missing and can be created
            This is really good to analyze index problem such as which query is missing index
