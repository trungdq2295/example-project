MongoDB
	Document based NoSQL
	Structure is Database > Collection > Document
	Can be real time DB
	
On Listener real time , MongoDB has resume token


MongoDB
	Type of instances
		Standalone
		Replication
		Sharding

Mô hình:
	Standalone
		Advantages: Dễ dùng
		Disadvantages: Not high availability, Too many read/write can cause high latency
	Replication
		Là mô hình primary - secondary ( giống slave-master trong RDBMS)
		Advantages: High Availability
		Disadvantages: Still perform read/write in single server ( primary or secondary when primary failed)
	Sharding
		Là mô hình chia DB ra thành nhiều phần nhỏ
		Advantages:
			High Availability
			Can scale horizontally by adding more shard
		Disadvantages
			Complexity

Deployment:
	Cloud:
		MongoDB - Atlas ( Free for 512MB)
	On premise

Architecture
	Thường mỗi database sẽ có 1 DB memory đẻ cache lại data và persist data xuống file,
	và hầu như db nào cũng call đến memory trước, nếu không cso thì mới call xuống file để lấy data

	And in MongoDB, it has storage engine and each storage engine has it owns pros and cons
		+ MMAPv1 (old storage engine)
		+ WiredTiger Storage Engine
			- Good for most use cases
		+ In-memory storage engine ( only available in MongoDB enterprise version)



Storage Engine
	WiredTiger


Optimize performance in MongoDB
	- Index on column
		When we use composite index, the first column index is very important, you need to create index on the first column which the query used to filter
		Example: the query  filter by  name and your index is on age and name then your index won't work since the first column indexed is age and the query doesnt filter by it
			=> Need to create index (name,age)
