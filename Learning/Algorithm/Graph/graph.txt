Before we started:
	In Tree data structure, if we have N nodes -> we have (n-1) edges. One edge for each parent-child relationship
Graph
	There's are no rule for connections in graph
	A graph G is an ordered pair of a set V of vertices and a set E of edges
		G = (V, E)
	ordered pair: (a,b) # (b,a) if a#b
	
	Edges:
	Directed
		For example: from node u to v 
			So we call the origin is u and the destination is v. It's an ordered pair so you cant switch from v to u. It's 1 way 
	Undirected
		For example: from node u to v and node v to u
			It's 2 ways and it represents as an un-order paired
	
	Weighted Graph
		is where each edge between vertices has a value called a weighted, which can represent information such as distance, cost, time or any measure
		Example: A road network where cities are vertices, and roads between cities are edges. The weight on each edge might represent the distance or time required to travel between the cities.

		Adjacency Matrix
			A 2D array to represent a graph
			For example:
							A	B	C	D
						A	0	1	0	0
						B	0	0	1	1
						C	0	1	0	0
						D	0	0	0	1
				This mean we have directed from origin A to B with the value is 1, and there's on edge between A and C or D, the same for the rest
				Advantages: Time Complexity O(1) since we know the index, we can the value directly from array
				Disadvantages: Space complexity O(n^2) since we need to store all the edges
		Adjacency List
			an array or array list of linkedlist
			
				Advantages: Time Complexity O(n) since it's a linkedlist, it loop from left to right
				Disadvantages: Space complexity O(V * E), we only need to store the node pointer to the next destination
		
		
	Unweighted Graph
		is where the edges (connections) between vertices do not have weight. it simply represent connections between vertices without any additional information
		Example:  A social network where users are vertices, and friendships are edges, but we donâ€™t care about how strong those friendships are.
			A - B - C
