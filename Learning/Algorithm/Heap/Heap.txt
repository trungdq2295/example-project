Heap
    Is a complete binaryTree but starting from root it will be the minimum/maximum value
    So every time, we iterate each level, the next level node's value will always lower/higher than the previous value level
    There's no requirement between the node in the same level as long as the previous level is lower/higher than them

    How to store it
        We can use array list, starting from root and move left to right
            => leftChild = 2 * parentIndex
               rightChild = 2 * parentIndex + 1
