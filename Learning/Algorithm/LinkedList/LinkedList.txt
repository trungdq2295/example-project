LinkedList
    doesn't have index like ArrayList
    It works like node links to other nodes
    O(1) if we add new node at the beginning or the end
    O(1) if we remove node at the beginning
    O(n) if we remove node at the end, because we have to iterate all the node to know which is the last node after remove the last one
