n: is the total element
O(n)
	is to scan all the element ( you have n element => you scan n element)
O(log n) 
	Important: In computer science, log n is refer to the log n to the base 2, not to the base 10 like in mathematic
	every time you scan, you scan half of it
		1st scan: you scan n/2 element,
		2nd scan: you scan n/4 element, 
		...
	So the time you scan will be equal to the heigh of binary tree,
		=> height = n/(2^x)
		=> x = log (n) to the base 2
