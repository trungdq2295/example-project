Data Type in Java
	2 types
		Primitive Types - store the actual value
		Reference Types - store the address of object they refer to
		
	Primitive
		Integerers
			byte 	- 1 bytes 				-  -128 to 127 
			short 	- 2 bytes 				- -2^15 to 2^15-1
			int 		- 4 bytes 				- -2^31 to 2^31-1
			long 	- 8 bytes 				- -2^63 to 2^63-1
		Float
			flaot 	- 4 bytes 
			double - 8 bytes
		Boolean
			boolean - depend machine - can be bit (1/0) or character  (true/false)
		Characters
			char 	- 2 bytes				 -  0 to 65,535
		
	Variable
		is a piece of memory that can contains a data value 
		is strongly typed language: each variable a  type 
		is defined by the combination of identifier and a type 
		can declare by "var" keyword - data type will be defined by java compiler 
		has a scope, which defines their visibility
		can't give a name to a variable of java keyword
		
		You can't convert from larger data type to smaller since it require more memory allocation 
		You can convert from smaller data type to larger smaller since larger type has enough memory allocation for it 
		
		Compiler will read the literaly value during compilation process to see if the value is in range of data type 
		
		Autoboxing is to  convert wrapper class into primitive type ( Integer to int)
		Unboxing is convert primitive type to wrapper class (int to Integer)
