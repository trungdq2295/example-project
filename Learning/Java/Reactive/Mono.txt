Mono - a Publisher
	It emits 0 or 1 item
		Example: The subscriber can request 3 or more records, but the producer provide 0 or 1 item only
		
	onErrorDropped happend when there's an exception but there's no handler for error so the publisher will call operator called default onErrorDropped
	
	
	"Mono.just" method is to use when there's available data ( for example: in your memory)
	"Mono.fromSupplier" method is to use when you don't have any subscriber yet, it will invoke if only there's subscriber ( lazy - loading)
	"Mono.fromCallaber" is similar to fromSupplier but you can throw Exception, and supplier you have to handle exception
