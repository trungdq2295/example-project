Topological Sort
    What is it?
        is an ordering of the nodes in a directed graph where for reach directed edge from node to node B, node A appears before nodes B in the ordering
        It can find a topological ordering in O(V+E) time
        Note: Topological ordering are NOT unique

        Not every graph can have a topological ordering. A graph which contains a cycle cannot have a valid ordering
        Example: A connect B, C. C connect D. D connect B -> cycle graph A -> C -> D -> B -> C ...
             A
            / \
           B - C
            \ /
             D
        The only type of graph which has a valid topological ordering is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). These are graph with directed edges and no cycle

    How to do it?
        Pick an unvisited node
        Beginning with the selected node, do the DFS exploring only unvisited nodes.
        On the recursive callback of the DFS, add the current node to the topological ordering in reverse order
