Greedy
    Is to build a solution step by step, selecting most advantageous option at each step with the hope that this strategy will lead to an optimal solution
    When to use
        Choice property: A global optimum can be arrived at by selecting a local optimum
        Optimal substructure: An optimal solution to the problem contains an optimal solution to the sub problem
    Pros
        Efficient: faster than other like DP as it avoids exhaustive search and complex recursion
        Simple to implement: Straight forward because it needs the most optimal solution
    Cons
        It doesn't always produce the globally optimal solution
