Backtracking
    In some problems, as we search for a solution, we may reach a dead end and have to go back and search again
    Recursive solutions are a natural fit for backtracking, but it's tricky to see the backtracking in recursive solution
    Everytime we search, we need to keep track the visited so if we reach the point visited point, we can skip it

    The easiest approach is not to think about the backtracking at all
    Just imagine you are calling a different, working function
