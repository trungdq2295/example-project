Motivation
    You are calling foo.bar()
    This assumes that foo is in the same process as bar()
    What if, later on, you wan tto put all Foo-related operation into a separate process
        Can you avoid changing your code?
    Proxy to the rescue!
        Same interface, entirely different behavior
    This is called a communication proxy
        Other type: logging, virtually, guarding,...

Proxy
    A class that functions as an interface to a particular resource. That resource may be remote, expensive to construct or may require logging or some other added functionality

Summary
    A proxy has the same interface as the underlying object
    To create a proxy, simple replicate the existing interface of an object
    Add relevant functionality to the redefined member functions
    Different proxies (communication, logging, caching, etc.) have completely different behaviors
