Motivation
    Balancing complexity and presentation/usability

Facade
    Provides a simple, easy to understand/ user interface over a large and sophisticated body of the code

Summary
    Build a Facade to provide a simplified API over a set of classes
    May wish to (optionally) expose internals through the facade
    May allow users to escalate to use more complex APIs if they need to
