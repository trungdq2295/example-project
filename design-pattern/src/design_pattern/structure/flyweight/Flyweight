Flyweight
    Motivation
        Avoid redundancy when storing data
            EG: MMORPG
                Plenty of users with identical first/ last names
                No sense in storing same first/last name over and over again
                Store a list of names and pointers to them
            EG: bold or italic text in the console
                Don't want each character to have a formatting character
                Operate on ranges (e.g, line number, start/end position)

    A space optimization technique that let us use less memory by sotring externally the data associated with similar object
