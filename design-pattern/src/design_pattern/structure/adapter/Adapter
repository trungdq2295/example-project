Motivation
    To adapt the old system from the new system


Adapter
    A construct which adapts an existing interface X to conform to the required interface Y

Summary
    Implementing an Adapter is easy
    Determine the API you have and the API you need
    Create a component which aggregates ( has a reference to, ... ) the adaptee
    Intermediate representations can pile up : use caching and other optimizations
