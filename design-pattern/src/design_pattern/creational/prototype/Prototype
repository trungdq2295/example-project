Motivation
    Complicated Objects (e.g, cars) arent designed from scratch
        They reiterate existing designs
    An existing (partially or fully constructed) design is a prototype
    We make a copy (clone) the prototype and customize it
        Requires "deep copy" support
    We make the cloning convenient (e.g. via a Factory)

Prototype
    A partially or fully initialized object that you copy (clone) and make use of

Summary
    to implement a prototype, partially construct an object and store it somewhere
    Clone the prototype
        Implement your own deep copy functionality;
        Serialize and deserialize
    Customize the resulting instance
