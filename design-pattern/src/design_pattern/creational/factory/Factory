Motivation
    Object creation logic becomes too convoluted
    Constructor is not descriptive
        Name mandated by name of containing type
        Cannot overload with same sets of arguments with different names
        Can turn into "overloading hell"
    Wholesale object creation (non-piecewise, unlike Builder) can be outsourced to
        A separate function (Factory Method)
        That may exist in a separate class (Factory)
        Can create hierarchy of factories with Abstract Factory

Factory
    A component responsible solely for the wholesale (not piecewise) creation of object

Summary
    A factory method is a static method that creates objects
    A factory can take care of object creation
    A factory cna be external or reside inside the object as an inner class
    Hierarchies of factories can be used to create related object
