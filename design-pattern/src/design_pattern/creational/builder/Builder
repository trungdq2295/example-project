Motivation
    Some objects are simple and can be created in a single constructor call
    Other objects require a lot of ceremony to create
    Having an object with 10 constructor arguments is not productive
    Instead, opt for piecewise construction
    Builder provides an API for constructing an object step-by-step

Builder
    When piecewise object construction is complicated, provide an API for doing it succinctly

Summary
    A builder is a separate component for building an object
    Can either give builder a constructor or return it via a static function
    To make builder fluent, return this
    Different facets of an object can be built with different builders working in tandem via a base class
