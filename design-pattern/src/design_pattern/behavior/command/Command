Motivation
    Ordinary Java statements are perishable
        Cannot undo a field assignment
        Cannot directly serialize a sequence of acitons (calls)
    Want an object that represents an operation
        X should change its field Y to value Z
        X should do w()
   Uses: GUI commands, multi-level undo/redo, macro recording and more!

Command
    An object which represent an instruction to perform a particular action. Contains all the information necessary for the action to be taken such as undo/redo,...

Summary
    Encapsulate all details of an operation in a separate object
    Define instruction for applying the command (either in the command itself, or elsewhere)
    Optionally define instructions for undoing the command
    Can create composite command (aka. macros)
