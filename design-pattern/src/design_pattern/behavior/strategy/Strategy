Motivation
    Many algorithms can be decomposed into higher- and lower-level parts
    Example: Making tea can be decomposed into
        The process of making a hot beverage (boil water, pour into cup); and
        Tea-specific things( put teabag into water)
    The high-level algorithm can then be reused for making coffee or hot chocolate

Strategy
    Enables the exact of behavior of a system can be selected either at run-time(dynamic) or compile-time (statiC)
    Also known as a policy

Summary
    Define an algorithm at a high level
    Define the interface you expect each strategy to follow
    Provide for either dynamic or static composition of strategy in the overall algorithm
