Motivation
    Components may go in and out of a system at any time
        Example: Chat room participant
            Players in MMORPg
    It makes no sense for them to have direct references to one another
        Those references may go dead
    Solution: have then all refer to some central component that facilitate communication

Mediator
    A component that facilitates communication between other components without them necessarily being aware of each other or having direct (reference) access to each other

Mediator means you create a component and everyone communicates through that component

Summary
    Create the mediator and have each object in the system refer to it
    Mediate engages in bidirectional communication with its connected components
    Mediator has functions the components can call
    Components have functions the mediator can call
