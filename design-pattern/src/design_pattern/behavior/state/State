Motivation
   Consider an ordinary telephone
    What you do with it depends on the state of the phone/line
        If it's ringing or you want to make a call, you can pick it up
        Phone must be off the hook to talk/make a call
        If you try calling someone and it's busy, you put the headset down
    Changes in state can be explicit or in response to event(Observer pattern)

State
    A pattern in which the object's behavior is determined by its state. An object transitions from one state to another (something needs to trigger a transition)
    A formalized construct which manages state and transitions is called a state machine

Summary
    Given sufficient complexity, it pays to formally define possible states and event/triggers
    Can define
        State entry/exit behaviors
        Action when a particular event causes a transition
        Guard conditions enabnling/disabling a transition
        Default transaction when no event are found
