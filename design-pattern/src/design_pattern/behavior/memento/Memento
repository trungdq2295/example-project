Motivation
    An object or system goes through changes
        E.g, a bank account get deposits and withdrawals
    There are different ways of navigating those changes
    ONe way is to record every change (Command) and teach a command to "undo" itself
    Another is to simply save snapshots of the system

Memento
    A token/handle representing the system state. Lets us roll back to the state when the token was generated. May or may not directly expose state information.

Summary
    Used to rollback state arbitrarily
    is not required to expose directly the states to which it reverts the system
    CAn be used to implement undo/redo
