Motivation
    Textual input needs to be processed
        E.g: Turned into OOP structure
    Some examples
        Programming language compilers, interpreters and IDEs
        HTML, XML and similar
        numeric expressions ( 3 +4/5)
        Regular expression
    Turning strings into OOP based structures in a ocmplicated process

Interpreter ( Thông dịch viên)
    A component that processes structure text data. Does so by turning it into separate lexical tokens ( lexing) and then interpreting sequences of said tokens (parsing)


Summary
    Barring simple cases, an interpreter acts in two stages
    Lexing turns text into a set of tokens,
        e.g: 3 *(4+5)  -> Lit[3] Star Lparen Lit[4] Plus Lit[5] Rparen
    Parsing tokens into meaning ful constructs
        -> Multiplication Expression ..
    Parsed data can then be traversed
