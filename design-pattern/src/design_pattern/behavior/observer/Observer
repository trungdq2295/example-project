Motivation
    We need to be informed when certain things happen
        Object's field changes
        Object does something
        Some external event occurs

     We want to listen to events and notified when they occurs
     Typical pattern invovles addxxxListener()
     Java now has functional object
        Supplier<T>, Consumer<T>, Function<T>

 Observer
    is an object that wishes to be informed about events happening in the system. THe entity generating the events is an observable
