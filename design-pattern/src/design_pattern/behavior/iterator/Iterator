Motivation
    Iteration (traversal) is a core functionality of various data structures
    An iterator is a class that facilitates the traversal
        Keeps a reference to the current element
        Knows how to move to a different element
    Java has Iterator<T> and Iterable<T>
        Iterator<T> specifies the iterator API
        A class needs to be Iterable in order to support

Iterator
    An object that facilitates the traversal of a data structure


Summary
    An iterator specified how you can traverse an object
    Iterator cannot be recursive (no coroutines)
    Iterator implements Iterator<T>, iterable object implement Iterable<T>
